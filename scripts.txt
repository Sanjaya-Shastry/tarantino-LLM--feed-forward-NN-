          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
          cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.

                         DJANGO
          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
          structure.

          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
          of the auction block.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2

                         DJANGO
          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
          the block.
          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

                         DJANGO
          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
          buy Niggers, who look up to him.
          His heart fills with poison.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
          blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

          THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
          end.


          /--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
          their black skinned cargo forward.
          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
          resemble a human locomotive.
          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
          fur collars.

          WHEN...
          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
          rifles for possible trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3

          A BLACK HORSE
          carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
          foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
          hat on his head.

                         DICKY SPECK
          Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
          State your business, or prepare to get
          winged!

                         THE RIDER
          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

                         THE RIDER
          (to the Slavers)
          Good cold evening gentlemen.
          (to the shivering Slaves)
          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
          slave traders that go by the'name of
          The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

                         ACE SPECK
          Who wants to. know?

                         THE RIDER
          I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
          is my horse, Fritz.
          Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
          him.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You a doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Affirmative.

                         DICKY SPECK
          What kinda doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
          purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

                         ACE SPECK
          So what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LE
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, I wish to parley with you.

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
          second language. Amongst your inventory,
          I've been led to believe, is a specimen
          I'm keen to acquire.
          (to the slaves)
          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
          VOICE rings out;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO
          Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz is delighted.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

                         DJANGO
          Dem da Brittle Brothers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So Django, do you think you could recognize -
          ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
          Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE SPECK
          Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like what?

                         ACE SPEC
          Like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English, goddamit!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
          trying to conduct a transaction.

                         ACE SPECK
          I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
          sale.
          Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

                         ACE SPECK
          Move it!
          Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, did you simply get carried away
          with your dramatic gesture, or are you
          pointing that weapon at me with lethal
          intention...?

                         ACE SPECK
          Last chance, fancy pants
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Very well -
           The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
          darkness.
          The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
          holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
          .BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
          direction...

          BAM...
          Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
          .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
          When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
          hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
          Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
          The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
          white man before.
          Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
          Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
          pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.
          Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
          Dicky's body.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          I only shot your brother, once he threatened
          to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

                         (COUNTING OUT

                         THE SLAVES)
          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
          seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

                         DICKY SPECK
          My damn legs busted!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
          caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
          to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          As I was saying, if you were to see
          the Brittle Brothers again, would you
          recognize them?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
          look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
          unshaven white men, can you honestly
          and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
          outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
          letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
          are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
          front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
          shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
          As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
          white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
          her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
          faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
          Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
          and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I can point 'em out.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
          Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          I'm gonna lose this leg!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, unless you find a talented physician
          very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
          end result. But back to business, how much
          do you want for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          You go to hell!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be silly. How much for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          800 dollars!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
          the slave trade that you and your family does,
          but neither was I born yesterday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8
          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         DJANGO
          Huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         0
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, and on the off chance that there's
          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.

          EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

                         DJANGO
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your horse?

                         DJANGO
          What horse?
          Dr.SCHULTZ'
          The horse you're riding.

                         DJANGO
          This ain't my horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is.

                         DJANGO
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
          it.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /1

                         DJANGO
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
          up in no stable.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't worry about all that!
          They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
          then says with a smile;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Tony what?

                         DJANGO
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          Why Tony?

                         DJANGO
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
          tell ya.
          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

                         TEXAS"

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /Z
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.

          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          million other visitors.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's this bizarre obsession they have
          with. you not riding horses?

                         DJANGO
          You askin' me?
          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

                         DJANGO
          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What part would they find the most offensive?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         13

                         DJANGO
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
          I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
          at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."
          He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
          establishment.

          INT - SALOON - MORNING
          The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
          saloon.
          The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
          table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
          away from the two patrons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
          weary travelers.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
          for about a hour. But by then we'll be
          servin' breakfast -
          He turns around and sees them.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
          get that nigger outta here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IT

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
          of the bar to get the Sheriff.
          When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          The Saloon Keeper runs away.
          The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
          The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
          from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
          like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
          it's a disaster - But these days I practice
          a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
          This gets no reaction from Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          The Black Man shakes his head, no.
          As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

                         HE EXPLAINS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well the way the slave trade deals in
          human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
          deals in corpses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          The state places a bounty on a man's head.
          I track that man, I find that man, I kill
          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.
          I show that corpse to the authorities -
          proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
          - At which point, the authorities pay me
          the bounty.
          (lifting his beer)
          Cheers.
          The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

                         DJANGO
          What's a bounty?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's like a reward.

                         DJANGO
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Certain people, yes.

                         DJANGO
          White people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

                         DJANGO
          Bad people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Badder they are, bigger the reward.
          Which brings me to you, and I must admit
          I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
          to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
          On the other hand, I need your help,
          and if you're not in a position to refuse,
          all the better. So for the time being,
          I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          work to my benefit.

                         (BEAT)
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
          So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
          an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
          however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
          disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
          what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

          ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
          Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I know what they look like, all right.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
          with me till we find them -

                         DJANGO
          - Where we goin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hear at least two of them are overseeing
          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
          dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
          I've already gave him to you -- but once the
          final Brittle brother lies dead in the
          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
          Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
          watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
          Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
          As they do, The Sheriff says;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 2

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
          start trouble, and scare all these nice
          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -
          From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
          toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

          .THEN...
          A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
          apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
          The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
          The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
          dirt.
          The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
          As is Django.
          As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
          his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
          skull, killing him dead.
          In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
          Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now you can go get the marshall.

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
          U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Move that buckboard over there long ways
          across the street from the saloon. And I
          want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
          And I want two men with two rifles on this
          roof, and two men with two rifles on that
          roof, with all barrels pointed at that
          front door. And somebody git poor Bill
          outta the goddamn street.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LP
          Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
          building across the street from the saloon.
          The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
          The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

          WHEN...

          COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

          INT - SALOON - DAY
          Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
          He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
          player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
          who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
          on the window.
          Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
          including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
          He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          I think they wonderin' why you playin'
          the piana'.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good.

                         (PAUSE)
          But what are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
          around out front, now they hidin' behind it
          with guns. And a buncha other white folks
          are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
          down here.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
          marshall out there?

                         DJANGO
          If the one I think is the.marshall is the
          marshall, he's out there.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What makes you think he's the marshall?

                         DJANGO
          Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          You in the saloon!
          Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          We got eleven Winchesters on every way
          outta that buildin'! You got once chance
          git outta this alive! You and your nigger
          come out right now with your hands over
          your head, and I mean, right now!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          First things first! Is this the marshall
          I have the pleasure of addressing?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
          myself of all weapons, and just as you
          have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
          with my hands raised above my head.
          I trust as a representative of the
          criminal justice system of The United
          States of America, I shant be shot down
          in the street, by either you or your deputies,
          before I've had my day in court.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
          'em down like a dog in the street!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
          have your word as a lawman not to shoot
          me down like a dog in the street?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
          somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
          cheat the hangman in my town!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          They're a little tense out there. So don't
          make any quick movements, and let me do
          the talking.
          Django looks at him like, "as if..."

          EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
          A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
          Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
          The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
          outside.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You unarmed?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
          address you, your deputies, and apparently
          the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
          incident that just occurred?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Go on!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
          yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
          court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
          with a price on his head of two hundred
          dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
          or alive.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          The hell you say!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
          news. But I'm willing to wager this man
          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years
          ago he was rustling cattle from,
          The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
          Lubbock Texas.

          circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
          of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
          He will back up who I am, and who your
          dear departed sheriff was.
          The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
          Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In other words marshall, you owe me
          two hundred dollars.

          EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
          together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
          Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
          business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
          Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
          Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
          times. A man who survives, is a man with
          a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
          a good plan. So, having said that, what's
          your plan, young Django?

                         DJANGO
          What'cha mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, after this Brittle business is behind
          us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
          seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
          What's your plan after that?

                         DJANGO
          Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
          Do most slaves take the institution of
          matrimony seriously?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?

          Do slaves believe in marriage'?

                         DJANGO
          Me and my wife do.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where is she now?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
          and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
          She got sold two days 'fore me.
          But I don't know who to.
          Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Care for some jerky?

                         DJANGO
          Sure.
          Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

                         SCHULTZ SAYS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
          purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
          where she is?
          A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
          the dilemma, then pronounces;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
          So how long ago did all this happen?

                         DJANGO
          A few months ago.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Three or four?

                         DJANGO
          Three.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.
          Not to mention a slave auction town in
          Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
          visit. Free or not.

                         DJANGO
          I'll have my freedom papers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes you will. But say you show them to some
          rascals, and they take them from you and
          tear them up?

                         DJANGO
          They could do that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not saying they would, but they could.

                         DJANGO
          They do that I'll kill 'em.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
          man. The point being is the place,is just
          too dangerous for you.

                         DJANGO
          Well I gotta go, when do I go?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you get more dangerous.

          You're playing a character. Your character

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
          We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
          blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
          BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
          riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
          As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
          steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
          stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
          wonder at this sight.
          The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
          a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
          mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
          man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
          While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
          majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
          FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
          The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.

          in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
          BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
          Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
          at the darkee on the horse.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          I said niggers -

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Z .ate`
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Django, he's a free man, and
          he can ride what he pleases.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Not on my.property, around my niggers
          he can't.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          Fritz, does his head bow.
          This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          State your business.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I wish to purchase one of your
          nigger gals.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
          Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
          no appointment, no nuttin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm afraid so.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
          say about that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
          I've been led to believe you to be,
          I have five thousand things I might say,
          that could change your mind.
          i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
          Spencer laughs.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
          to drink.
          The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
          Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black
          creatures to escort Django here around
          your magnificent grounds.

                         SPENCER
          Absolutely. Betina!
          A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
          BETINA, snaps to attention.

                         BETINA
          Yes sir, Big Daddy?

                         SPENCER

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          What's your Jimmies name again?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django.

                         SPENCER
          Betina sugar, take Django around the
          grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

                         BETINA
          As you please, Big Daddy.
          Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

                         SPENCER
          Understood., Schultz. Betina?

                         BETINA
          Yes, sir?

                         SPENCER
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
          man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
          him like any of these other niggers around
          here, cause he ain't like any of these
          other niggers around here. Ya got it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         BETINA
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          folks?

                         SPENCER
          No that's not what I said.

                         BETINA
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Yes, I can see that.

                         (HE THINKS)
          What's the name of that peckawood boy from
          town works with the glass? His mama works
          at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
          the winda's when we have a problem?
          The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

          MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
          Oh, you mean Jerry.

                         SPENCER
          Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

                         (TO BETINA)
          You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

                         BETINA
          Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          like you would Jerry.

          EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
          Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
          him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
          the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

                         BETINA
          What'cha do for your massa'?

                         DJANGO
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

                         BETINA
          So you really free?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ZY

                         BETINA
          You mean you wanna dress like that?
          Django fumes.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
          lemonade.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
          Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
          The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.
          He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
          pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

                         BETINA
          What'cho want?

                         DJANGO
          I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
          brothers. Overseers. Their name is
          Brittle. Do you know 'em?

                         BETINA
          Brittle?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
          And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

                         BETINA
          I don't know dem.

                         DJANGO
          They could be usin' a different name.
          They woulda' come to the plantation in
          the last year.

                         BETINA
          You mean The Shaffer's?

                         DJANGO
          Maybe? Three brother?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Are they here?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Can you point one of 'em out to me?

                         BETINA
          Well ones over in that field.
          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
          Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
          takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
          Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
          his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
          field landscape.

                         SPYGLASS POV:
          Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
          who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
          observation.

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

          BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
          he lowers the glass.

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          Is that who you lookin' for?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

                         DJANGO
          Where's the other two?

          BETINA.
          They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
          for breakin' eggs.

                         DJANGO
          They whippin' Little Jody?
          She nods her head, yes.

                         DJANGO
          Point me in that direction.
          She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

                         BETINA
          You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
          Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

                         DJANGO
          Go git that white man, I came here with.
          He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
          Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
          and The Brittle Brothers.

                         FLASH ON
          A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
          wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
          PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
          LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
          Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

          BULLWHIP.
          DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.

          She's real sorry!
          The WHIP RIPS her back.

                         DJANGO

                         (SCREAMING)
          Goddamit, Big John!

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
          Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
          Brittle with everything he has.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

                         FLASH ON
          Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

                         KNEELING DJANGO;

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          I like the way you beg, boy.

          EXT - STABLE - DAY
          Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
          to a dead tree stump.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
          LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
          ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
          yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
          are clumsy. You'd break everything in
          goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
          only known cure for nigger clumsiness
          is a peelin'.
          Little Jody begs to differ.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
          Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
          who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
          BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
          little dogs no nevermind.

          In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

          After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

                         DJANGO
          turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
          him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

          WHEN ...
          .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

                         DJANGO
          John Brittle!
          Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
          length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
          stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
          Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
          Bulldogs.
          LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
          the same thing in the mirror.
          LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
          BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
          DJANGO just stares back.
          BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
          So does Roger.

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Django?
          Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
          shake his hand ...

                         DJANGO
          Remember me?
          .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
          contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
          bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

          BIG JOHN FACE
          goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
          heart, at Django.

                         DJANGO
          I like the way you die, boy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3 3
          Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
          LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
          FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
          it.
          LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
          gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
          gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
          It goes off... BANG.
          SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
          The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
          DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
          LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
          MORE SLAVES gather.

          DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
          whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
          Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
          To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
          Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
          Django, and the two dead bodies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Who are they?

                         DJANGO
          That's John Brittle, and that's his
          little brother Raj.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where's Ellis?

                         DJANGO
          He's the one hightailin' it across that
          field right now.
          Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
          to make an escape.

                         SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
          goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you sure that's him?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I dunno.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't know if you're positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I don't know what, positive,'means.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It means you're sure.

                         DJANGO
          Yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, what?

                         DJANGO
          Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

          BAM!
          The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
           The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
          RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
          The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
          Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
          and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
          The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
          Django does the same with his pistol.
          Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

                         SPENCER
          Just who the hell are you two jokers?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35;
          Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
          of the criminal justice system of the
          United States of America. The man to my
          left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
          In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
          court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
          Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
          alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          Roger Brittle --

                         DJANGO
          - They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
          After his dramatic pause for effect...
          .Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I please remove the warrant from my
          pocket so you may examine it?
          Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
          paper.

                         SPENCER
          Gimmie.
          Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
          the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
          what it says.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Satisfied.
          Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I have that back?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          ,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We good?

                         BENNETT
          Get off my land.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Post haste.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Load up the bodies as quickly as
          you can, and let's get out of
          here.

                         TIME CUT
          All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
          the bounty hunters brought with them.
          Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
          With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
          start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
          for one final threat.

                         BENNETT
          Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
          while you on my property. But for lettin' a
          nigger kill a white man, and especially for
          letting a nigger kill a white man in a
          audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
          it out of the county alive. Mark my words
          Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
          gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
          from my motherfuckin' gate.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
          regulator playmates aren't shy about
          killing for what you believe in. But mark
          my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.
          The two men ride off.
          The Black and White Audience watch them go.

          lying on his belly in the grass.

          That's them sonsabitches.

                         SPENCER'S POV:
          We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
          Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
          lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
          We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
          CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
          The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
          Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
          all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
          holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
          Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
          steed..

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Now unless they start shootin' first,
          nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
          for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
          nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
          personally, strip and clip that garboon
          myself.
          Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
          head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
          this thing.
          He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
          holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

                         BRADSHAW
          We ready, or what?

                         (RIPS)
          Shit ...I just made it worse.
          He rips. it off his head in frustration.

                         RANDY
          I can't see shit either.

          Willards wife.

                         WILLARD

                         SPENCER

                         (TO WILLARD)
          Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
          what Jenny did.

                         REDFISH
          Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
          could cut it better then this.

          0. B.
          How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

                         ROBERT
          Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
          I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
          But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
          all over, and I'm riding blind.
          Randy tears at his bag.

                         RANDY
          Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
          He puts it on-then says;

                         RANDY
          Yep, it's worse.
          He yanks it off his head.

                         RANDY
          Did anybody bring any extra bags?

                         TERRY
          No, no one brought a extra bag!

          I'm just asking.

                         DOUG
          Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

                         SPENCER
          Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
          up, that just defeats the purpose.
          Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

                         REDFISH
          I can't see in this fucking thing!
          I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
          And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

                         WILLARD
          Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
          my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
          ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
          And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
          From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
          Willard rides off.
          O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

                         SPENCER
          O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
          not dead.

          O.B.
          But Willards riding off.

                         SPENCER
          Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
          here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
          And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

                         RANDY
          Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
          Robert takes off his bag, and says;

                         ROBERT
          I think we all think the bags was a nice
          idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
          could of been done better. So how 'bout,
          no bags this time, but next time, we do the
          bags right, and then we go full regalia.
          Everyone takes off their bag.

                         SPENCER
          Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         YO

                         TERRY
          But nobody can see.

                         SPENCER
          So?

                         TERRY
          So, it would be nice to see.

                         SPENCER
          Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
          can't see, so what? All that matters is can
          the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
          Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

          EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
          The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
          the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
          haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
          ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
          don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
          everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

          WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
           OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
          "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
          off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
          Then amongst the confusion...

          WE SNAP ZOOM TO

          A BIG TREE
          on the other side of the lake
          Then quickly cut into The Tree.
          Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
          with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

          SCOPE SIGHT POV
          The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
          inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.

                         TWO SHOT
          Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Auf wiedersehen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          L,
          He fires.
          The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
          Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Let 'em have it!

                         DJANGO
          I can't see nothin'.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just fire into the smoke.
          The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

          INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
          pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
          bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
          bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
          sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
          Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
          still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
          worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
          more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
          ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
          dogs.

                         SPENCER BENNETT

          SCOPE SIGHT POV
          We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

                         DJANGO
          scope sight rifle up to his eye.
          Schultz next to him, says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          He's getting away.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          He's getting out of range.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.
          INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
          what sounds like an incoming missle.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
          RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

                         DJANGO
          I got 'em.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          falls from his horse, dead.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like that, huh?
          Referring to the scope sight rifle;

                         DJANGO
          I like.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, I think while they take this opportunity
          to lick their wounds, we should take this
          opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
          They hop out of the tree.

                         MONTAGE
          Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
          first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
          purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
          with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
          handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
          Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
          He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
          on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
          his winter coat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
          Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
          the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
          dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
          You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
          You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
          even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
          You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

                         DJANGO
          She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
          If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
          where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
          were sayin' where I gotta go first?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There'should be some sort of records office.
          You know when she was sold, you know where
          she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
          you know her name ... . what is her name?

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda.
          Schultz reacts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda?
          Django.nods his head yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Were her owners German?
          Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
          The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
          a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          speak a little German too.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your wife?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
          her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So let me get this straight, your slave
          wife speaks German, and her name is
          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yep. Mouthful, huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To say the least.
          (stopping the horse)
          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
          Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          cup of tea.

                         DJANGO
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

                         DJANGO
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

                         DJANGO
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes there is.

                         DJANGO
          Do you know it?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

                         DJANGO
          What she do.?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

                         DJANGO
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like blow up.
          He pantomimes a explosion.

                         DJANGO
          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

                         DJANGO
          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

                         DJANGO
          Does Sigfried save her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
          He walks through hellfire because
          Broomhilda's worth. it.
          After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
          as they nibble on their sandwiches.

                         DJANGO
          I know how he feels.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think I'm just starting to realize that.
          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
          thinks about what he's going to say next.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

                         DJANGO
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
          What's not to like?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

                         DJANGO
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
          Big John and Rodger?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

                         DJANGO
          What'd ya mean partner up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

                         DJANGO
          You makin' another agreement?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         W7
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes. You work with me through the winter,
          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

                         DJANGO
          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

                         DJANGO
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
          Django accepts that response.
          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

                         WE SEE
          A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          to be good at this.

          EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
          been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
          PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
          case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          Y, 8

          DOWN BELOW WE SEE
          A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
          helping him by leading the horse forward.
          On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Keep down or he'll see you.

                         DJANGO
          Who that farmer? Who cares?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
          just might.

                         DJANGO
          What? The little man pushin' that plow?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And he's all yours my boy.
          DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

          SCOPE SIGHT POV:
          on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
          and his son.
          Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
          folks for money?

                         DJANGO
          His son's with him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
          Maybe even share a last word. That's
          better then most get, and a damn. sight
          better then he deserves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1Ï¿ï¿½9
          Django still hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
          mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
          Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

                         DJANGO

                         (READING)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
          stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
          for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
          hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
          Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
          follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

          CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
          is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
          twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

                         (REFERRING TO

                         THE HANDBILL)
          But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
          and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
          You want to save your wife by doing what
          I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
          and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
          is worth seven thousand dollars.
          Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
          Django SHOOTS.
          The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
          The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
          his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's good luck. You always keep the
          handbill of your first bounty.
          They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
          leading the extra body horse behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         50
          As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
          Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
          last words to his son before he dies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, they're having a tender little father son
          moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
          they've ever had.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
          It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
          Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
          a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
          heart would be.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the bottle heart!
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the left coal eye.
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the right coal eye.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the carrot nose.
          Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think it's safe to say you're faster then
          the snowman.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
          A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
          a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

          FROM ABOVE.

          DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
          up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

          EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
          the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
          with five corpses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         571
          The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
          and who the hell ya got there?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
          Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
          it down to the friendly peace officer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
          And three of their acolytes.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
          nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
          'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
          snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

          TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
          They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
          coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
          liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
          bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
          third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
          "That one", Schultz says.
          Django RIPS IT off the wall.
          As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
          hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

          EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
          The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
          practices his fast draw against five men...
          .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
          DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
          falls to the ground to get the fifth.
          He looks up from the ground at Schultz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5L
          As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You're pretty confident aren't you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You have reason to be.
          He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
          All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          top of Django.

                         DJANGO
          Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
          Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
          sure.
          He blows out the match...

          WE GO TO BLACK
          What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
          slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
          steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
          He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

          EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
          brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
          have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         53
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
          the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
          selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
          BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
          LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
          through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
          along.
          BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
          PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
          A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
          SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

          THE KIDS ALONG.
          Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

                         GREENVILLE

          CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
          Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
          other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
          Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
          Greenville operates.
          As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
          MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
          Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
          The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
          Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
          outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
          wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
          Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
          PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

          WE FLASH ON
          The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

          INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
          amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
          pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
          A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
          SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

                         JUDD
          Good god almighty these niggers stink!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         I F

                         RUSS
          Niggers stink, where's the shock?
          (to the Slaves

                         BELOW)
          Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
          well, I'm only gonna say this once.
          There's a slave corral right across from
          this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
          doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
          can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
          trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
          niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
          any African garboons amongst y'all can't
          understand english ... . your American buddies
          better shove your ass in the right direction,
          or your trip to this country is going to be
          short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
          you can!
          The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
          run full out from the train to the steer corral.
          We spot Django during the running.
          Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
          COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

          INSIDE THE CORRAL
          through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
          the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
          view.
          Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
          LADIES, then she's gone from view.

          BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
          Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
          Greenville.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a spectacle out of Dante.

                         DJANGO
          You should see it from the other side.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

                         DJANGO
          You'd be surprised what you can endure.

          INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
          Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
          We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
          enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
          RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
          routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

          BLACK TITLE CARD:

                         BROOMHILDA

          INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
          The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
          the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
          Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
          Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

          EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
          We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
          WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
          the leg irons scrap her ankles.
          Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
          in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
          perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
          Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
          to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
          Street.
          Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
          was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
          buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
          so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

                         BROOMHILDA
          looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
          breath which one will buy her.
          Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
          the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
          twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
          he nudges his dad.
          The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
          back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
          branded in her cheek.
          Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
          of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
          feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

          SELLER - CLYDE
          Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
          nigger gal gentle.

          On that day, eight months ago, the auction
          was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
          for his fat boy son Scotty.
          Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
          From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
          Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
          the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

                         SCOTTY
          This is for you.
          She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

                         SCOTTY
          They're jelly beans. Try one.
          She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

                         SCOTTY
          Good huh?
          She nods her head, yes.
          We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
          back eating her bag of jelly beans.

          $XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
          back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
          Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
          Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
          realize the young master is the shy type.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Master Scotty... ?

                         SCOTTY
          Yes Broomhilda?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
          you on that seat so we can talk?

                         SCOTTY
          Please, I'd love that.
          She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

          EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
          A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
          The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
          buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
          Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
          his new bought nigger gal.
          The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          What's your name, gal?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Broomhilda.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          Follow me. into the kitchen,
          ('to her son)
          You stay out here.

          INT - KITCHEN - DAY
          Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
          that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
          Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
          my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
          girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
          with him, they fool with him for the wrong
          reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
          man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
          He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
          eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
          wrong, you'll deal with me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
          needs is a little confidence.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          And you'll give that to him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          He is, isn't he?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Ah-huh.
          The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

          Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
          bride for young master Scotty that day.
          And the two kids had a nice time playing
          house for awhile.
          We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
          the daytime..
          At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
          At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
          Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
          no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
          even join the family at their dinner table.
          We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
          gravy.

          NARRATOR.(VO)
          And pretty soon she was adopted into a

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After three months of this bliss,
          Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
          a romantic weekend in Greenville.

          SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
          drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
          fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
          complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
          Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
          described as plantation pimp daddy.

          White masters would take their pretty
          Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
          excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
          how bad the other slaves had it, always made
          the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
          position, (just in case they'd forgot).

                         BROOMHILDA
          holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
          OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

          INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
          Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
          lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

          INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
           Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
          showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

                          NARRATOR (VO)
          And two, there was a sliver of society that
          ran through Greenville at night that catered
          to white masters who were infected with a
          condition that was normally referred to as,
          "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
          bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
          white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

          The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
          white men and black women).
          Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
          room.
          We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
          sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
          I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
          I love you. And if loving you means I go to
          hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
          That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
          was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Then... speak of the devil and the devil
          appears.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          appears at their table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
          The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
          to welcome an attractive couple'like
          yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
          Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

                         SCOTTY
          Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
          We love it here.
          Pointing at a empty chair.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          May I join you?-

                         SCOTTY
          Please, by all means.
          Calvin sits down.
          Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
          Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long have you been a member?

          We just joined this weekend.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well our little private oasis appreciates
          your patronage. Some may consider the dues
          excessive, but they're necessary for us to
          create this haven for the alternative
          lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

                         SCOTTY
          Well said, and money well spent.
          He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
          Candie sees this.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my
          friends at my table.
          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
          with a, "Don't be silly."
          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
          join the party.
          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
          is a little more revealing then the others.
          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After excusing herself, she walked across
          the street to her hotel room. She got
          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
          to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
          scrape every pimple.

          The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
          wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
          card game. As the game wore on, it came down
          to a two thousand dollar pot between
          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          something in his ear.

                         CANDIE

                          (TO SHEBA)
          Really?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          You know what Sheba just tole me?
          Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

                         SCOTTY
          What?

                         CANDIE
          She says she thinks you're cute.

                         SCOTTY
          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
          beautiful.
          Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

                         CANDIE
          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          lip. Want some lip?
          Scotty, is a little surprised.

                         SCOTTY
          Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

                         CANDIE
          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
          Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
          intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
          Calvin's side of the table.
          The game continues.

          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
          brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
          it. If you're really holding cards, time to
          pony up. I raise you five hundred.
          Candie throws in his chips.

          SCOTTY.
          I see your five hundred...

          .and raise you four hundred more.

          Not so fast, boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Pot ain't fat enough yet.

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Ain't that too bad.
          Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
          pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

                         SCOTTY
          I would think a southern gentleman of
          such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
          to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
          Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One final raise.
          Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's Sheba's bill of sale.

                         SCOTTY
          What? I don't want her.
          Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
          More laughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Greenville slaves are currency. And
          Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
          I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
          fold?

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all out of money.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But we ain't playin' for money no more..
          We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
          you got.

                         SCOTTY
          I can't bet Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
          or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
          and a pencil.
          Somebody does.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
          Scotty makes a pressured decision.
          He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
          Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          Let me see your cards!
          Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
          What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

                         SCOTTY
          You cheated me.
          After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What did you just call me?

                         SCOTTY
          I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
          cause that's what you are!
          Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
          Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
          Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
          himself .

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         66
          Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
          in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
          I challenge you to a duel.
          (to the Piano

                         PLAYER)
          Piano player, will you hit three separate
          notes?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          On the third note, pick up the gun and
          try to kill me.
          (to Piano player)
          Piano player please ...
          This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

                         SCOTTY
          Wait a minute ...no!

          FIRST NOTE ...

                         SCOTTY
          I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
          to duel!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then get out of here, get in your buggy
          and get out of town.

                         SCOTTY
          Sure. Let me just get my girl.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You lost that girl, fat boy.

          SECOND NOTE...

                         SCOTTY
          Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
          called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
          give you Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
          to fuckin' another one.

                         (BEAT)
          Or pick up that gun.
          Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
          parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
          leave.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         6 7

          THIRD NOTE...

          .Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He
          YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies
          naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and
          backside.
          She hops out of bed.

          INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
          Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs,
          down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door.
          All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS.

          She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
          GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking
          down at her.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Welcome to Candyland.
          We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face.

          INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
          Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
          The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
          Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
          fill the big hall.

          ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
          stands half naked on the auction block.
          The SELLER' (SHELBY)
          gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
          Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
          Calvin Candie.
          Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
          /-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
          FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
          We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
          always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
          hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
          Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
          owner of Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, so you heard of it?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
          and apparently the repellent gentleman down
          there is the one who owns her.

          ï¿½ï¿½` TIME CUT

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         6R
          The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
          hall.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
          a couple niggers he'd fight.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you play a mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          What?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
          who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

                         DJANGOÂï¿½
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo
          expert I hired to help me do it.

                         DJANGO
          They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          One-Eyed Charly?

                         DJANGO
          That's what you call it when you buy a slave
          expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
          He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
          don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
          Dr'. SCHULTZ
          Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         70

                         DJANGO
          You know, back on the plantation, my. job
          wasn't historian.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
          legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
          play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
          yes, if you can't.

                         DJANGO
          You want me to play a black slaver? There
          ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
          slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
          Django gets that.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you do that?

                         DJANGO
          That, I can do. What's next?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To get ourselves personally invited to
          Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
          Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club.
          Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
          houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
          They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
          steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
          A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the

          The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
          A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

          Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
          a tasty refreshment?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Not at the moment.

          Dr.SCHULTZ

          Cleo leaves.
          Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

          INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
           A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS

          special treat).

          The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
          The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
          The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
          driven American dining.
          The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
          elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
          The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
          splits, and cookies.
          While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
          sarsaparilla.
          Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Have you ever seen anything like this
          before?
          Django shakes his head, no.

          Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
          like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
          alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we

          LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

                         MOGUY
          Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
          in creating the opportunity for this
          appointment.
          Mr.MOGUY
          Nonsense, it's my job.

                         (CON'T)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         73
          Mr.MOGUY

                         (CON'T)

                         (LOOKING AT

                         DJANGO)
          .So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
          so much about.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
          lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
          room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
          along too?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We would be quite lucky indeed if the
          charming Coco cared.to follow.
          Coco blushes.

                         MOGUY
          You better watch out doctor, you gonna
          steal this little pony's heart.
          They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

                         SAY;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How long have you been associated with
          Mr.Candie?

                         MOGUY
          Calvin and I were about eleven when we
          went to boarding school together. One
          could almost say, I was raised to be
          Calvin's lawyer.

                         DJANGO
          One could almost say, you a nigger.
          Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
          Mr.Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          What did you say?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
          Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
          know before I meet him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         7EF
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What civilized people aren't?

                         MOGUY
          That's why all the French ambiance. And
          he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
          Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRENCH)
          What ever he prefers.
          This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

                         MOGUY
          Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
          French to him, it'll embarrass him.
          They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
          Moguy slides the doors open...
          The party enters the billiard room.

          INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
           Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
          the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
          Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
          fight to death in this closed room.
          An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
          Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

          VASSEPI.
          Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
          and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Why do you want to get in the mandingo
          business?
          That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
          Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
          (referring to Moguy)
          .to make the proper introductions?
          Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         7S

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Quit stalling and answer the question.
          The room is quiet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The awful truth?

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm bored, and it seems like a good
          bit of fun.
          Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
          goin on that's a good bit of fun_
          Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
          The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
          Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
          CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
          Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
          death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

          CALVIN CANDIE.
          The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
          him today. What's his name, Moguy?

                         MOGUY
          Big Fred.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
          Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

                         (TO AMERIGO)
          What's your nigger's name?

                         AMERIGO
          Luigi... .?
          Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
          Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
          named, ROSCOE tends it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
          a good bit of fun?

                         DJANGO
          You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How'd you two like to try the signature drink
          of the club?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         79
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We'd love to.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          (yelling to the

                         BARTENDER)
          Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
          don't spare the rum.
          Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
          Big Fred kills Luigi.
          Candie and his friends cheer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
          like you owe me ten dollars.
          Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
           Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
          sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
          Candle turns his attention to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's your name, boy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Where'd ya dig him up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          A fortuitous turn of events brought
          Django and myself together.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
          real bright boy.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm curious, what makes you such a
          mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
          Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          What you say, boy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         77
          /ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
          you directed your line of inquiry to me.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
          neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
          if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
          didn't seek you out for your advice. I
          sought you out to purchase a fighting
          nigger at above top dollar market price.
          I was'under the impression when you
          granted me an audience, it would be to
          discuss business.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No we weren't talking business yet. We
          were discussing my curiosity.
          Now according to Moguy here, if I do
          business with you...

                         (POINTING TO

                         SCHULTZ)
          , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

                          (POINTING TO

                         DJANGO)
          He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
          but more or less, yes.
          None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
          needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
          Candie turns his attention back to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
          looked over my African flesh, and were
          none too impressed.

                         FLASH ON
          we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          BACK TO CLEO CLUB

                         DJANGO
          Not for top dollar.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well then we got nothing more to talk
          about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
          from me, those are the beat ass niggers
          I wanna sell.

                         DJANGO
          He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
          sell. He wants the nigger you don't
          wanna sell.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
          sell.
          Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You won't sell your best. You won't even
          sell your second best. But your third
          best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
          I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
          forced to consider it... . who knows what
          could happen?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you consider ridiculous?
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          For a truly talented specimen,
          ."The Right Nigger"..:?
          How much would you say, Django?

                         DJANGO
          Twelve thousand dollars.
          Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
          you got my attention.

                         TIME CUT

          TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
          in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
          And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.

          How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
          Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO COCO)
          How's your Catfish, dew drop?

                         COCO
          Real good Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          You spend a lot of time around niggers
          aside from Freeman here?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Not so much.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
          treat this was for 'em. You feel special
          Coco?

                         COCO
          Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You feel special Bartholomew?

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

                         SHEBA
          Yep.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
          special?

                         DJANGO

                         (MEANING SHEBA)
          Not as special as her.
          The table breaks out in laughter.

          tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
          kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
          You oughta come with us.
          Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
          suppose I could be amenable to that.
          How far must we trek?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
          in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
          There you can get a look at my best
          specimens. Have dinner with my sister
          and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
          my guest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

                         WE CUT

          EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
          "Candyland."
          Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
          (BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
          Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
          with'supplies.
          FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
          SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
          walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
          possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

          THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
          WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
          walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
          possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
          pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
          with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         J

                         RODNEY
          walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
          slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
          the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

                         FLASH ON
          Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

                         RODNEY
          gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

          DJANGO ON TONY
          sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
          that shit stand.
          He yells down to the powerless man;

                         DJANGO
          Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
          Rodney looks away.

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          You want a boot heel in it?

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
          Flash that bad look at me again,
          I'll give ya reason not to like me!
           As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
          not without difficulty.
          Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How do you like this side of the slave
          trade?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Prefer the other side?

                         DJANGO
          I didn't say that.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Are you sure it's her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          He didn't call her by name, but she's a
          young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
          speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
          assume, in this instance, I think it's
          pretty safe.

                         DJANGO
          Did you offer to buy her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I opened the door to my possible interest.
          But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
          so interested.

          SUDDENLY ...
          Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Am I intruding?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Of course not.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (APPRAISING THE

                         TWO MEN)
          I swear you two are cozier then a couple
          of cuttle fish.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You'd be surprised what a good
          conversationalist Django is.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh by now, I don't think that would
          surprise meat all.
          Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
          Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When do we reach your property?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          1?3

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          You been on it. I own the whole sixty
          miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
          Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

                         (YELLING BEHIND
          him at Billy)
          Billy Crash, git up here!
          Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
          rides up.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Yeah, Boss?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Find out what that goddamn commotion
          is up at the tracker shack!

                         BILLY CRASH
          Right away, Boss.
          Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know, confidentially, just 'tween
          us girls, worse things about this
          business, ain't the slaves. It's all
          the white trash ya gotta deal with.
          Like these peckawoods we got riding with
          us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
          ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
          niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
          holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
          it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
          And don't think they don't know it either.
          It's about the only thing these dumbass
          motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
          Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
          niggers ass, other than somebody might as
          well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
          boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
          they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
          inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
          gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
          a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
          patience, that German lady taught Hildi
          how to speak German.
          Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
          ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.

                         (CON'T)
          Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
          hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
          understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
          could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
          of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
          to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
          wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
          they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
          Billy Crash comes riding back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell's goin on?

                         BILLY CRASH
          They got 'em a runaway.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Who?

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
          A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
          slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
          A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
          bunkhouse.
          The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
          long haired lot.
          Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
          JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
          or just from the same hollow.
          Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

          MARSHA.
          A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
          surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
          One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
          fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
          been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
          not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
          mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
          patch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O V5
          The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
          the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
          Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
          down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
          old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
          a fool thing like run off?

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
          win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
          shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
          myself think!
          Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
          Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
          (to the other

                         TRACKERS)
          Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
          he's just makin' em hungry.
          The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long was he loose?
          Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          A.night. Day. Half the other night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How far he git off property?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
          considering that limp he got.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
          Friday?.

                         MOGUY
          (pointing behind him)
          One of this new lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
          wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

                         (TO D'ARTAGNAN)
          Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
          a tail on a teddy bear.
          D'Artagnan starts begging.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
          soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
          Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
          business. Now I done paid five hundred
          dollars for you. And when I pay five
          hundred dollars, I expect to get five
          fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
          and play dead. You've fought three fights.

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I won every one.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
          muddied the line between winning and losing.
          Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
          on the ground.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
          dollars, I want five fights. So what
          about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
          reimburse me?
          The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
          This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
          Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
          The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
          watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
          The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
          know what to expect from their new home.
          Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
          bastard.
          Calvin prods further.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You even know what reimburse means?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         E 17
          The Whites laugh.
          Then SUDDENLY ...
          .The German Speaks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'll reimburse you.
          All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
          Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
          Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
          direction of the good German.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You will?
          Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
          one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
          broom?
          Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

                         DJANGO
          No he won't.
          All eyes turn to Django.

                         DJANGO
          He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
          all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
          ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
          we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
          right, Doc?
          Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
          to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
          billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO CANDIE)
          You heard 'em.
          The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
          green jacket, slack jawed.
          !` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
          jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
          like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
          Mr. Stonesipher?
          Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          That's right.
          Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
          Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well now since you won't pay a penny for
          this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
          this nigger however I see fit?

                         DJANGO
          He's your nigger.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
          bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Marsha...git 'em!
          The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
          Shepherds back.
          The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

                         THE MANDINGOS
          all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
          The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
          As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
          Candie.staring contest with Django...
          Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
          the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
          The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
          The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
          Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
          appears not to enjoy it.
          Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
          ï¿½-. to Django.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         P9

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Your boss looks a little green around
          the gills for a blood sport like
          nigger fightin'?
          As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

                         DJANGO
          Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
          ripped apart by dogs, is all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But you are use to it?

                         DJANGO
          Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
          a little more use to American's then
          he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
          ready, we rode five hours so you could
          show off your stock. Let's git to it.
          Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
          ain't impressed.
          Calvin...BLINK...
          Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
          his horse, then looks at the black man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Follow me.
          The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          apart.

          EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
          picking it.
          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
          Django.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         90
          All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
          get a better look at the black riding a horse.
          Django looks back matching their stare.

          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
          among his SHEEP.
          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
          begins tossing them about.
          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

          THEN ...
          .DJANGO rides by.
          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
          huge dust cloud behind it.
          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
          ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
          the Big House to greet her brother.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
          steps...

                         STEPHEN
          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
          South. -
          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

          THEN...
          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
          and for a moment don't know what to think.
          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
          limp.
          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello Stephen my boy!

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
          this nigger up on that nag?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
          shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
          on that nag?

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Snowball.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          : Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

                         DJANGO
          If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
          my horse, you ask me.

                         STEPHEN
          Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
          horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
          goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
          funny. Django's a Freeman.
          Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

                         STEPHEN
          This nigger, here?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
          the two of. you. Django, this is another
          cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
          Stephen, this is Django. You two should
          hate each other.
          Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
          blacks at Candyland.

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
          feel the need to entertain?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
          are customers, and they are our guests
          Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
          .are to show them every hospitality.
          Do you understand that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't know why I gotta -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You don't hafta know why, do you
          understand?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Good. They're spending the night. Go up
          in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         93

                         STEPHEN

                         (POINTING AT

                         DJANGO)
          He's gonna stay in the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

                         STEPHEN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          In the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You gotta problem with that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
          problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
          and the pillow cases once this black ass
          motherfuckers gone!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
          Your problem, right now, is making a
          good impression. And I want you to start
          solving that problem right now, and git
          them rooms ready.
          The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

                         STEPHEN
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
          Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
          to her brother on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
          is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
          Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
          Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
          Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
          Django,
          (Django tips his hat)
          and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
          Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And it is our great delight to encounter
          this flaming rose.

                         LARA LEE
          Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
          You're not from around here, are you?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually I'm from a far off land,
          Dusseldorf, to be exact.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          These two are in the market for a fightin'
          nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
          show 'em my stock.

                         LARA LEE
          We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Half the reason I invited them. I thought
          you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
          little sister.
          Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
          All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
          two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
          Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
          CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
          Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
          As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
          Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know since I started fightin' niggers
          about eleven years ago, it's been a new
          lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
          now is the man responsible for all my
          success.
          Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
          Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
          Schultz.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Howdy Ace.

                         (TO SCHULTZ

                         AND DJANGO)
          This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
          nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
          Ace Woody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         915
          Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
          Cody.

                         (TO ACE)
          Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
          Django Freeman, they're big customers with
          big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
          brought 'em out here so you could give
          'em a little display of our African flesh.
          Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
          Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
          Django.
          Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
          Greenville to here.

                         ACE WOODY
          These the new chickens?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get?

                         (HE COUNTS)
          One, two, three, four, five.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Five real strong bucks.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get rid of?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We still got three left.
          Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
          Leo Moguy chimes in;

                         MOGUY
          I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
          they'll be here tomorrow.
          Ace turns to Brown.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE WOODY
          Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
          the pen till tomorrow.
          Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
          the slave pen.
          Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
          Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

                         ACE WOODY
          Y'all stand over there and make a line!
          They do.
          Ace climbs down from off his horse.
          Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
          Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
          Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
          Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you think?

                         ACE WOODY
          I think you lookin' for niggers to push
          a plow, 'dem your boys.
          Candie rolls his eyes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's wrong with them?

                         ACE WOODY
          Hold it...hold it, you done bought
          r em, let me look at 'em.
          Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
          buy that one?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Which one?

                         ACE WOODY
          What you mean, which one? The one I'm
          pointing at, that one.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Actually, that one was purchased by
          our mister Moguy.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO MOGUY)
          You bought him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Why?

                         MOGUY
          I like his prospects.

                         ACE WOODY
          His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
          I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
          Remind me again what prospects means?

                         MOGUY
          Hope for the future.
          Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          You got hope for his future?

                         MOGUY
          I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well I don't.
          Ace walks over to the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          What's your name, boy?
          The mandingo says;

                         SIDNEY JAMES
          Sidney James, sir.

                         ACE WOODY
          So long Sidney James.
          Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
          Sidney James point blank in the belly.
          Everybody reacts.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
          Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
          Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
          Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
          Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
          Ace looks up at his boss.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

                         CALVIN CANDIE

          Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
          Candie acts out mock frustration.
          The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

          Welcome to Candyland, boys!
          Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
          Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          We only get about two out of every batch
          of five fighters we buy. But those two
          tend to be lucky.
          Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
          that you don't trust my judgement?
          Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
          Boss Candie...eventually.
          He rides off.
          Stephen limps back to the action.

          There you can lie down and rest up
          for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
          some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
          my finer specimens.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
          Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
          Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
          of oats.
          Django hands the boy the reigns.

                         DJANGO
          That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
          care of 'em now.

                         TIMMY
          Yes, sir.
          Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

                         DJANGO
          Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
          He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

                         DJANGO
          Give that one to Fritz.
          Timmy leads the horses away.
          The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
          Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
          the nigger girl we were talking about?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Nigger girl?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I believe you said she spoke German?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you think before the demonstration you
          could send her around to my room?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't see why not.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, when you get through showing
          them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
          I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
          and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
          Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

                         STEPHEN
          Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
           somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         STEPHEN
          Hildi's in The Hot Box.
          This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's she doin' there?

          What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
          she bein punished.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What she do?

                         STEPHEN
          She ran away again.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
          when I was gone?

          Last night. They brought her back this
          morning.

          How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
          Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
          those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
          motherfuckers right now.

                         STEPHEN
          Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
          D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
          lookin' for her and found her. She a little
          beat up, but she did that to herself.
          Runnin' through them damn bushes.
          Django's hand moves away from his gun.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long she been in the box?

                         STEPHEN
          What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
          fool got ten more days to go.

          Take her out? Why!

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
          my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
          hospitality dictates I make her available
          to him.

                         STEPHEN
          But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
          havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
          wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
          I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
          her out.

          Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
          Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
          sizzling in it.
          The HOT BOX
          itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
          Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
          men lift the heavy iron door open.
          REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
          dug into the ground.
          Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

          WHEN ...
          Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
          Django watches this.
          DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
          BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

          REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
          as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
          Stephen breaks the mood.

                         STEPHEN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
          little box?
          Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
          Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

          INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
          Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
          the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
          rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
          the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
          room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

          INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
          A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
          pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
          lamp and a tiny bell on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         105

                         STEPHEN
          This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
          nice too.
          Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
          Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
          rattles on in the background.

                         STEPHEN
          Feel free to touch anything you want,
          cause we burnin' all this shit once you
          gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
          door when the demonstration ready.
          Django sits down on the bed.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Not so fast.

                         STEPHEN
          I got more important things to do then
          jaw with you.

                         DJANGO
          Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
          Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

                         DJANGO
          This tiny bell on this little table...
          .is this for you? I ring this, you
          do fer me?

                         STEPHEN
          Me or somebody.
          Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
          (a soft) DING-A-LING

                         STEPHEN

                         (UNAMUSED)
          What 'cha want?

                         DJANGO
          I want you to pour some water in that
          bowl for my wash up.
          Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         )O'
          Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
          Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

                         DJANGO
          Gimmie.
          Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
          Django takes it from him.
          Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
          The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

                         DJANGO
          Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
          that?
          Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
          knocking him to the floor;

                         DJANGO
          That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
           The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
          he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
          Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
          floor below his knees.

                         DJANGO
          I've known me House Niggers like you my
          whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
          Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
          then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
          rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
          all the white folks think it's so cute.
          Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
          here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
          good side. Well this time Snowball, you
          gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
          you wanna sling my way, before they give
          us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
          give this whole motherfuckin plantation
          a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
          off your ass. I will make you drop your
          drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
          Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
          every nigga on this plantation. And after
          I do that, let's see you play the rooster
          round here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         X07

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

                         DJANGO
          Oh that's right, he gives you first name
          privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
          me again nigger, see what happen'.
          Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

                         DJANGO
          That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
          With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
          Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

                         DJANGO
          When I ring this bell, you better come
          a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
          I'm on this property, you my nigger
          Snowball.
          Stephen leaves.
          Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
          A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
          Schultz stands there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Was that wise?
          Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

                         DJANGO
          He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
          That's all that needs to be said.

          INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
           Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
          domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
          after Calvin's sister raps on it.
          Dr.Schultz opens the door.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Hello ladies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DOG

                         LARA LEE
          Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
          Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
          speaks German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO BROOMHILDA)
          I've been informed you do as well.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
          in German.
          Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Astonishing.

                         (IN GERMAN)
          Please come inside Fraulein.
          She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
          "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
          to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

          INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
          With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
          disoriented girl.
          He gives her a pleasant smile.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          They call you Hildi, but your real name
          is Broomhilda, isn't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes. How do you know that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Stands to reason who ever taught you
          German would also give you a German name.
          Can I pour you a glass of water,
          Broomhilda?
          Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
          to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
          on the frightened girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         107

          WE CUT TO DJANGO
          on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
          to present himself.
          BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
          As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
          talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
          a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
          I'm only speaking German to you now,
          Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
          listening to us. Myself and a mutual
          friend of ours, have gone through a lot
          of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
          find you fraulein - to rescue you.
          He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
          She looks at him weird, rescue me?
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Please drink.
          She absentmindedly obeys.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          (.GERMAN).
          Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
          intention to take you away from here
          forever.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          I don't got any friends.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
          flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
          surprise you.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          Where is he?
          He points at the adjoining door.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Standing right behind that door.
          Her head moves in the direction of the door.
          He looks to the young woman;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Promise me you won't scream?
          She nods her head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Say, I promise.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          I promise.
          Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
          The door knob turns.
          The door slowly opens revealing...
           Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
          He smiles at her, and says;

                          DJANGO
           Hey Little Trouble Maker.
          Obviously a pet name between them.
          Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
           .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
          the water spills on the floor ...
           .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1/1
          The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You silver tongued devil you.

                         MONTAGE
          WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
          they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
          is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
          soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
          vaguely optimistic ...
          WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
          The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
          Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
          sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
          continues over this scene.
          Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
          Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
          the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
          The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
          for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
          A study in powerless fury.

          DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
          in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
          She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
          The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
          Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
          Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
          What you. whistlin', girl?
          Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

                         STEPHEN
          What was you whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Oh nuttin'.

                         STEPHEN
          You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
          whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
          no.name.

                         STEPHEN
          It's kinder pretty.
          She doesn't say anything in return.

                         STEPHEN
          That was a compliment.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Thank you.
          Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
          such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
          run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
          Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
          The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
          you are two days later, whistlin' while you
          work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
          have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
          .I'm jus' sayin'.
          He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm done here, may I be excused?

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you may.
          She moves off to another part of the house.
          He watches her shuffle off.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
          Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
          They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
          Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
          Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
          Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
          Domestic Slaves despise Django.
          Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
          though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
          We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          called Eskimo Joe?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
          get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
          day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          All three are champions.
          Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

                         DJANGO
          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.
          All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
          contradict Calvin Candie.
          Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
          that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
          potatoes.

                         LARA LEE
          Hildi!
          Broomhilda snaps back.
          Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          then issues his own appraisal;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

                         DJANGO
          Maybe.
          The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
          admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
          game, I do have a bit of a background in
          the European traveling circus. Hence, I
          have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
          I need something more then just a big nigger.
          He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
          I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
          I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
          for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
          Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
          but is he right as rain ... ?
          Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
          sip of his mint julep, then says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
          is no one in the nigger fight game that
          appreciates the value of showmanship
          more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
          one must not forget the most important
          thing in the nigger fight game.

                         (BEAT)
          A nigger that can win fights. That should
          be your first, second, third, four, and
          fifth concern. After you have that, and
          you know you have that, then, you can
          start to implement a grande design. But
          since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
          status - beating Moguy by one year for
          that honor allow the old sage to advise,
          first things first.
          Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
          Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
          She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I see you two gettin' on?
          Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          .Famously.

                         (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
          Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
          it's like not to hear you native tongue
          for four years.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Â»5
          Everybody at the table chuckles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I can't express the joy I felt conversing
          in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
          charming conversation companion.
          As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
          how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
          Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

                         LARA LEE
          I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
          the German sweet talk you want, but it
          looks like this ponys got big eyes for
          Django.
          Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
          Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

          AND ...
          .STEPHEN sees it.
          Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
          Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
          Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
          kitchen.
          Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
          mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
          a drink in this house in twenty years.

                         STEPHEN
          When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
          a COLD drink.
          Chuckle... . chuckle...

                         CALVIN CANDIE

          me spending two weeks in Boston

          What? They laughed!

                         STEPHEN
          Of course they laughed, their parents
          raised them right. When they're a guest
          in somebody's house, and the master of
          of the house thinks he's- funny, you
          suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
          Chuckle... .chuckle...
          They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No it was really funny,

          wasn't it?

                         STEPHEN
          Now what do you expect these people to
          say? What you need to do is stop
          embarrassing your guest.

                         (TO TABLE)
          Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
          polite, I understand, you mean well, but
          it just encourages him.
          Chuckle-chuckle...
          As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

          TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
          eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

          She shakes her head, no.
          Stephen looks at her skeptical.

          Okay, if you say so.

                         DJANGO
          Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
          about it. But if it was my money, I
          wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
          for him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What would your price be?

                         DJANGO
          Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
          and I don't know why I would be inclined
          to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
          Candie's lawyer chimes in.

                         MOGUY

          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
          you cut that cake, that spells profit.
          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.

          Stephen, time for dessert!
          Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the

          Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may, Hildi.
          She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
          Candie looks up at her as she works.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          table in the big house?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

          With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
          Stephen clocks this.
          Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
          be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"

          clothes off?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          !20
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We just spoke.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So you haven't seen her back?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No I haven't.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
          find this interesting. Hildi, take off
          your dress, and show us your back.
          Django hears this.
          Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
          Stephen clocks it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          and looking nice.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
          they don't got niggers there. And he's a
          man of medicine. I'm sure it would
          fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
          pain. I mean Hildi got something like
          fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
          one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
          are tough, no doubt about it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
          Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
          Django continues to watching this play out.
          Stephen watches him.
          Candie folds.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
          During the brandies.
          Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
          kitchen.
          Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
          the kitchen door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         121

          INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

                         STEPHEN
          I thought you said you didn't know him?
          Broomhilda turns around.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Huh?
          Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

                         STEPHEN
          I said, you said, you didn't know him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Mister Stephen, I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you lyin to me?
          As tears begin to well in her eyes.

                         BROOMBILDA
          I ain't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you cryin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scarin' me.

                         STEPHEN
          Why am I scarin' you?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scary.
          Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
          table conversation begins to bleed inside.
          We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
          Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
          .to speak German,with Hildi this
          afternoon was positively soul enriching.
          Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1ZL
          His eyes to to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          You, stay in the kitchen.
          Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
          Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
          these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
          just figured it out.

          INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You indicated earlier you would be
          willing to part with Hildi?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob I did.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case allow me to propose
          another proposition?
          In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
          INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          - Monsieur Candie?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          (to Dr.Schultz)
          Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
          ain't worth a damn these days.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
          the kitchen.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What, you mean get outta my chair?

                         STEPHEN
          If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What about dessert?

                         STEPHEN
          I would rather tell you in private.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
          melodrama could be brewing back there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         123
          Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

                         STEPHEN
          Meet me in the library.
          Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
          has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
          library" is their secret signal.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
          Stephen exits.
          Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
          they are in the kitchen, from time to
          time, adult supervision is required.
          If you'll excuse me a moment.
          Candie exits.

          TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
          books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
          the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
          When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
          leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
          Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
          brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
          Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
          outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
          dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
          turkey.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's the matter?

                         STEPHEN
          Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
          mandingos. They want that girl. -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell you talkin' about?

                         STEPHEN
          They playin your ass for a fool, that's
          what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
          for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
          that girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What girl, Hildi?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He just bought Eskimo Joe.

                         STEPHEN
          Did he give you any money?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well not yet, but -

                         STEPHEN
          - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
          how. But he was just about to buy, who he
          came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
          Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
          go through all that trouble, to. buy a
          nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
          five hundred dollars?

                         STEPHEN
          Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
          love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
          Now why that German gives a fuck about
          who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
          with, I'm sure I don't know.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          If she's who they want, why the whole
          snake oil pitch about mandingos?

                         STEPHEN
          Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
          to four hundred dollar. But twelve
          thousand got you real friendly.
          Calvin thinks ...
          .as per usual, Stephen's right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
          sonsabitches!

                         (LOUDER)
          Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
          fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
          .gonna have us a Candyland tar and
          feathering!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         FL5

                         STEPHEN
          Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
          seein' something like that ... . but why
          don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
          huckster insinuate themselves at my
          dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
          plantation for a fool!

                         STEPHEN
          Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
          discuss this.
          A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

                         STEPHEN
          Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
          was something up with these two. We just
          didn't know what. But now we do. They
          don't want you to know how bad they want
          that girl. But these ole boys have rode
          a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
          trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
          bull to get this girl. They must want her
          mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
          changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
          wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
          changed is the advantage.

                         (BEAT)
          Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
          and busts these motherfucker's chops.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
           The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
          melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
          kitchen door.
          Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

                         SEEING HIM;

                         LARA LEE
          There you are! I was beginning to think
          you and that of crow ran off together.
          Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
          stares down the table at them.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
          Lara Lee?

                         (CON'T)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1Z J

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (CON'T)
          Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
          Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
          shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
          Would you be a dear and go out there and
          give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
          knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
          But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
          Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
          Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
          Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
          your shoulder?
          Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
          pointing at them.
          Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
          he's holding a big ugly hammer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
          They put their palms on the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now you lift those palms off that turtle
          shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
          loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
          There's been a lotta lies said around this
          table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

                         (BEAT)
          Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
          the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
          Mr.Moguy does.
          Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
          were just getting ready to make me a
          proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (YELLING TO

                         STEPHEN)
          Stephen! Bring out Hildi!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ix?
          Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
          roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
          against the side of her head.
          Django and Schultz react.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now it should be quite clear by now I know
          you're not here to buy no mandingos.
          Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
          want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
          to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
          you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
          horseshit.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, put her in that chair.
          Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
          With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
          silently watch Candie's next move.
          Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
          You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
          sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
          Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I take it you prefer the take it or leave
          it style of negotiating.
          Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
          Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
          anything with my property I so desire.
          He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
          everybody jump.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IN

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And if you think my price for this nigger
          is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
          is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
          death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
          He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
          this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I lift my hands from the table top in
          order to remove my billfold?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
          jacket, and says;,
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Easy come, easy go.
          He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
          takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
          the seated Schultz, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Pleasure doin' business with you.

                         TIME CUT

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
          .Moguy signs as a witness.
          Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
          freedom papers.
          Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
          All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
          Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
          Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
          For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
          thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
          runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
          dollars- for twelve thousand.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
          The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
          around pouring coffee for the white people.
          Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
          rhubarb pie with him.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Rhubarb pie?
          Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
          of ya?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually, I was thinking of that poor
          devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
          And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
          all this.
          Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
          bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
          examines he papers.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dumas...?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.
          If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
          wonder what he would of made of it?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You doubt he'd approve?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          at best.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Soft hearted Frenchy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas is black.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 30
          Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
          companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We got it, let's go.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
          auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
          actually means is, till I see you again,
          and since I never wish to see you again,
          to you sir, I say, goodbye.
          Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
          When Calvin says to the German's back;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One more moment, Doc!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a custom here in the South, once a
          business deal is concluded, for the two
          parties to shake hands. It implies good
          faith.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not from the South.
          He turns to leave.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
          I must insist.
          This turns Schultz around.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Insist what...? That I shake your hand
          before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
          insist in the opposite direction.
          Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know what I think you are?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What you think I am? No I don't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          1310,

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I think you are a bad loser.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And I think you're an abysmal winner.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
          a deal ain't done till the two parties have
          shook hands. Even after all this paper
          signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
          away twelve thousand dollars...?
          I don't think so.
          Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Let's go.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
          before this German shakes my hand.
          Cut 'er down.
          Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
          .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

                         CANDLE;
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          You really want me to shake your hand?
          Django gets it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I insist.

                         DR
          -Schultz smiles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, if you insist.
          Django goes to stop him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 714
          The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
          Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
          The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

          POP!
          He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
          Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
          falls to the floor.
          Everybody is stunned.
          Schultz looks to Django.
          Django looks back.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
          Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
          The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

          FADE TO BLACK

                         

                         

                         

                         
          We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
          The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
          it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
          The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
          are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
          whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
          three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

          INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
          Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
          with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
          Django begins to come to ...

                         TIMMY

                         (SHHH'S HIM)
          Act like you still sleepin'.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         TIMMY
          Who?

                         DJANGO
          Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
          couple of days ago. They had her in The
          Hot Box.

                         TIMMY
          I don't know 'bout no girl.

                         DJANGO
          How 'bout that German white man I came
          here with?

                         TIMMY
          Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
          Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
          friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
          the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
          Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
          Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
          bucket at the fleeing boy.

                         ACE WOODY
          Git on outta here, boy!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         133
          Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
          at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
          makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

                         ACE WOODY
          So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
          Django thinks, "How does he know?"

                         ACE WOODY
          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
          We found your wanted posters and book of figures
          in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
          heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
          boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          line of work?
          Django retorts, upside down.

                         DJANGO
          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
          Ace woody laughs.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
          Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
          length from the hanging man.

                         ACE WOODY
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
          'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
          everyone 'round here blames you.
          Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
          gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
          shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
          goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
          hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
          However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
          able to attend.
          Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
          . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
          Django's face.
          Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
          the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
          the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
          As he does this, he says;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE WOODY
          Now I understand you didn't really have
          nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
          sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
          to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
          asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
          But grieving folks 'round here need someone
          to blame. And I guess they figure if you
          hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
          in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
          And you know what, they got a point.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
          He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
          As he does he says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
          the error of his ways, believe me when I.
          tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
          book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
          there try an' git creative with the way they
          bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
          methods are, tried and true.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          Django JERKS his head back ...
          .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
          Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
          wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
          naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
          mercy.

                         ACE WOODY
          You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
          me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
          training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
          money I made my whole goddamn life.
          And no end in sight, neither.

                         (BEAT)
          Then you came along. Knocked me right off
          that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
          Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
          mandingos as her brother?
          Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
          is you done fucked up my good thang.
          So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
          could say I gotta axe to grind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IJS
          He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
          Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
          Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

                         ACE WOODY
          How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
          your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
          the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
          Django dances some more ...

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

                         (BREATH)
          On the count of three.

                         DJANGO SCREAMS:

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!!

                         ACE WOODY

          ONE ...

                         DJANGO

          NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

                         ACE WOODY
          Got to do it, boy. TWO...

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!! !
          Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
          facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

                         STEPHEN
          Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
          talk about the Old Man's funeral.
          Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
          Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
          Dickey people.
          While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
          Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
          of what almost happened.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO DJANGO)
          How disappointing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         171

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Where she at?

                         STEPHEN
          She in the big house. The kitchen.
          Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
          blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
          the fire.
          Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

                         ACE WOODY
          You gonna look after our friend?
          As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

                         STEPHEN
          Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
          01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
          upside down nigger we both know, gonna
          have us a big of chat.
          He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

          GLOWS ORANGE.

                         STEPHEN
          Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
          stick is all nice and FROSTY.
          Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
          Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
          alone.
          With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
          hanging Django.

                         STEPHEN
          I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
          on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
          Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
          You get the idea to go to Greenville -
          look up the Ole Man there.

                         (BREATH)
          That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
          believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
          buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
          to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
          whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
          Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
          goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
          Big House.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137

                         STEPHEN

                         (BEAT)
          And that's where you met me. And that's when
          you knew your goose was cooked.
          He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
          Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
          stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
          fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
          tip of that red hot poker.

                         STEPHEN
          Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
          didn't know what's what. He still thought his
          ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
          you are, you always know the end is near
          'fore the white folks.
          With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
          The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
          breathing it in his nostrils.

                         STEPHEN
          Damn Nigger, you smell good.
          He walks behind Django with the poker.

                         STEPHEN
          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
          bed in the quest room in the Big House -
          After you slapped my ass to the floor
          You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
          ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
          Remember that, Bright Boy?
          He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
          buttocks.
          Django SCREAMS!
          Stephen LAUGHS.
          Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
          through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
          the floor by the hanging man.

                         STEPHEN
          You leavin', that's what you can take
          with you.
          Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
          him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         I31

                         STEPHEN
          Now you were quite the topic of conversation
          for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
          never had a bright idea in their life, was
          comin' up with different ways to kill your
          ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
          wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
          like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
          niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
          "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
          Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
          "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
          mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
          And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
          We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
          the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
          worse then that."
          He stops massaging Django's balls.

                         STEPHEN
          So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
          your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
          And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
          you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
          every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
          And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
          'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
          the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
          Like them three y'all came back with. For them
          big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
          'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
          I give two or three.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         STEPHEN
          She's all right for now. Miss Lara
          soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
          to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
          Now Billy Crash might not look or
          smell too good, but ain't nobody
          gonna bother her.
          Stephen limps away.

                         CUT TO

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137

          EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
          The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
          up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
          prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
          2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
          trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
          a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
          The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
          stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

                         ROY
          It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
          the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
          git out.
          The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
          Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
          and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
          bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
          wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
          The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

                         FLOYD
          You blacks line up.
          They do.

                         FLOYD
          What's your names?

                         CHESTER
          Chester.

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Chicken Charly.

                         RODNEY
          Rodney.

                         FLOYD
          I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

                         (POINTING AT

                         CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
          What's that?

                         CHESTER
          It's my stuff.

                         FLOYD
          Throw it in the dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 40
          All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
          off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
          corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

                         FLOYD
          (to Chicken Charly)
          You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
          (to all three)
          You are now the property of The LeQuint
          Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
          This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
          the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
          Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
          Woody call out;

          ACE WOODY (OS)
          Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
          for ya.
          Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
          barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
          old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

                         ROY
          We can't use that skinny bastard.

                         ACE WOODY
          We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
          punishment niggers from time to time.

                         ROY
          No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
          confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

                         ROY
          Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

                         ACE WOODY
          - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
          Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
          Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
          wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
          how and why you fucked up our nice little
          business relationship, take this nigger and
          hush up about it!

                         ROY
          Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         "H
          Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
          Django stops Ace Woody.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
          with them. They'll kill me. What about all
          that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
          shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
          the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
          them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
          I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
          but I didn't think that was the idea.
          Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

                         ACE WOODY
          He can't go in there with them.

                         FLOYD
          Why not?

                         ACE WOODY
          They'll kill him.

                         FLOYD
          I don't give a damn.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
          we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

                         ROY
          Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
          black and make sure he keeps up.

                         JANO
          Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
          Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
          around his saddle horn.
          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

          EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
          Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
          Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
          riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.

          What's he pay you?

                         JANO
          Who?

                         DJANGO
          LeQuint Dickey?

                         JANO
          You gotta few more things to worry about
          black boy, then what I get paid.

                         DJANGO
          I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
          I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
          Mining Company, ain't I?

                         JANO
          Yeah.

                         DJANGO
          And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, dont'cha?

                         JANO
          Yeah?

                         DJANGO
          Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
          how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
          for instance, how much you gettin' paid
          for today?

                         JANO
          Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
          paid for our passage from Australia to here.
          We get a little money to send back home, and
          pay him back for the boat trip.

                         DJANGO
          How long you been here?

                         JANO
          'bout two years.

                         DJANGO
          And you ain't paid him back yet?

                         JANO

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          No, not yet!

                         DJANGO

                         (LAUGHS)
          You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
          your ass for the price of a boat ride.
          At least they didn't charge us for our boat
          ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

                         JANO

                         (YELLING)
          You shut up!
          Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
          Django, when the black man says to him;

                         DJANGO
          How'd you like to make eleven thousand
          dollars?

                         JANO
          What?
          Django steps closer to him.

                         DJANGO
          How would you like to make eleven thousand
          dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
          actually?
          Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

                         ROY
          Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
          and keep up!

                         DJANGO
          Keep riding, just ride slower.
          They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.

                         DJANGO
          Back at that plantation Candyland, there
          was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
          fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
          right past it.

                         JANO
          You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

                         DJANGO
          That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
          not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
          earn it.

                         JANO
          If you got something to say, say it.

                         DJANGO
          The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
          waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
          form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
          Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

                         JANO
          Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
          gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
          There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
          bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
          dollars for each of his three accomplices,
          Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
          And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
          there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
          cause they just got away with murder.

                         (BEAT)
          But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
          mates could get that money.

                         JANO
          Who pays the money?

                         DJANGO
          The Court.

                         JANO
          The Court?

                         DJANGO
          The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
          the way, the court don't give a damn about
          how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
          back, from up on a hill, in the back of
          the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

          Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
          long as you do it.

                         JANO
          They.pay us to kill 'em?

                         DJANGO
          No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
          corpse. Get it?

                         JANO
          I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

                         DJANGO
          Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
          robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
          Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
          Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
          He hands it to Jano.

                         JANO
          What's this?

                         DJANGO
          I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
          Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
          Jano looks at the handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Whatsamatter, can't you read?

                         JANO
          I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
          I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
          think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

                         DJANGO
          What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

                         JANO
          Roy?

          EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
          the side of the road.

          IN THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
          the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
          what they're watching.
          What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
          company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
          hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
          includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
          piece of paper.

          INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
          Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

                         DJANGO
          I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
          a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
          Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
          Candyland on a horse with my white German
          partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
          Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
          Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
          Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
          went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
          Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
          blame me, so here I am.

                         (TO ROY)
          You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
          know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
          But those four men, are still back there.
          They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
          five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
          last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
          and gittin it.
          Django is damn convincing.

                         ROY
          What's your deal? You tell us who they are
          and we let ya go?

                         DJANGO
          I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
          me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
          dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
          and I'll point 'em out to you.
          He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
          one little push.

                         DJANGO
          Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
          truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
          me in the same cage with them without them
          killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
          .am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
          there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

                         CUT TO

          ROY AND FLOYD
          go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
          Roy continues to study the handbill.

                         ROY

                         (READING ALOUD)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
          robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
          One thousand five hundred dollars for each
          of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

                         FLOYD
          Just because the handbill's real doesn't
          mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

                         ROY
          Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
          or alive handbill in his pocket?
          Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

                         ROY
          That black's damn convincing.
          They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

                         ROY
          (pointing, behind
          him, at Django)
          That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
          The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
          Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
          the barrel at the cage.

                         ROY
          I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
          like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
          he ride in with a white man yesterday?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CHESTER
          Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
          Auction and he rode on a horse with a
          white man.

                         ROY
          This white man, was the black his slave?

                         RODNEY
          He weren't no slave.

                         FLOYD
          You sure about that?

                         RODNEY
          Damn sure.
          Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
          seriously.

                         ROY
          What happened at Candyland?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

                         ROY
          Who shot 'em?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The German.

                         ROY
          And why did he do that?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The nigger and the German were actin as if they
          were slavers, but they weren't.

                         ROY
          What were they?

                         RODNEY
          Bounty hunters.
          Floyd is starting to get convinced.

                         FLOYD
          Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
          (to the Slaves)
          Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?

          They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
          you idiot!

                         CUT TO
          Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

                         ROY
          Okay black, you gotta deal.
          Jano reacts.

                         DJANGO
          I got one more condition.

                         ROY
          What?

                         DJANGO
          When we get there, when the time comes,
          you let me help you kill 'em.
          Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

                         ROY

                         (LAUGHING)
          You got a deal, black.
          Django interrupts -

                         DJANGO
          You gotta deal, mate.
          Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

                         ROY
          You're all right for a black fella!

                         THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
          cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
          all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

          BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

          We'll give you that pack horse.

                         DJANGO
          What's them saddle bags filled with?

                         FLOYD
          Dynamite.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          !so

                         DJANGO
          I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
          dynamite on his back!

                         ROY

                         (CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
          Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
          off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
          cage.
           Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
           the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
           and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
          at all.
          Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
          horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
          Cage Wagon.
          Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

                         DJANGO
          Where's my pistol?

                         ROY
          Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
          'em your gun and your belt.
          Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
          to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
          About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

                         FLOYD
          Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
          fixed last month, it's perfect.
          Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

                         DJANGO
          That's good to know.
          Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
          in the chest...
          Roy turns around...
          Django takes the gun out of the holster...
          . BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
          dead.
          Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
          Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
          The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
          The CAGE WAGON
          Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
          blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
          the air, obscuring all visibility...

          THEN ...
          A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
          REVEALING in bright color focus...
          .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
          Jano.
          He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
          wrapped around his waist.
          He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
          He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
          and climbs aboard him bareback.
          He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
          next to him.
          Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
          beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
          now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
          horses bring the best out of Django.
          From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

          .THEN...
          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
          cage door.
          He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

                         DJANGO
          Throw up that dynamite.
          Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
          his Horse.
          Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
          without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
          The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
          "Who was that nigger?"

          A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
          the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
          Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
          'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
          A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
          Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
          Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
          mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
          The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
          wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
          crying at her side.

                         CORA
          The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
          Candie think it real nice.

                         LARA LEE
          Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

          WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
          of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
          backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
          hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
          gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
          The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
          -Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
          The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
          next to the bunkhouse.

          INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
          The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
          wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
          mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
          your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
          (yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
          that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
          Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
          delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

          EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET
          INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on
          to the ground.

          The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her
          head...

                         SHIRTLESS DJANGO
          moves quietly through the woods.

                         MARSHA
          rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
          PALS continue to lay out.

          DJANGO BY A TREE
          he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
          chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

                         MARSHA

          BARK!
          The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
          Django disappears.

          INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
          They hear the barking inside.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Jake!
          Jake building his birdhouse.

                         JAKE
          Yeah?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Check on Marsha.
          Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
          check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK
          As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
          chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

                         JAKE
          opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
          him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

          DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

          JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
          opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
          the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

          STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
          That weakens Stonesipher.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
          That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
          That puts the mountain man down on his back.
          He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
          The Trackers are all dead.
          Only the dogs mad barking remains.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT

          words over him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
          Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
          out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
          over to the WATER PUMP.
          Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
          He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
          begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

                         DJANGO
          What ya doin around here, boy?
          Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

                         TIMMY
          I was just walkin' by.

                         DJANGO
          Wanna help me out?

                         TIMMY
          Sure.

          Will I get in trouble?

                         DJANGO
          Not by the time I get through killin'
          everybody.
          Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

                         TIMMY
          I'll show ya.

          THEN ...
          Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

                         DJANGO
          You know what toadstools look like?

          the tracker shack.
          Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
          Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
          the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
          He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
          mixes it up with the spoon.

          EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
          Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
          It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
          The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
          the stew.
          Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

                         DJANGO
          You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
          Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

          First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

          Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
          straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
          see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
          He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
          And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

                         DJANGO

          Now, boy!
          Timmy hops to work.
          Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
          bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
          searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
          holster around his ankle.
          As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

                         TIMMY
          Do you feel bad for your friend?
          Django rises from the body of his friend.

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, "I do.
          As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

                         TIMMY
          I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
          friend once. He drowned in the lake.
          Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
          friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
          understand.
          He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
          furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
          And finally his hat.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I can't.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I can't help it! I'm really sad!
          He hops off her and yells at her.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
          for niggers! Git use to it!

                         (CALMING DOWN)
          Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
          from way back. But you know I've always been
          sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
          So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
          You calm down.
          He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
          WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
          Django, she cries for herself...

          .THEN...
          She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
          And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
          Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
          Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
          front door.

                         CU BROOMHILDA
          Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
          A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (SOFTLY)
          Yes?
          The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         157
          She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

          THERE HE IS,
          she runs into his arms.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
          The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
          dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
          The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
          funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
          overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
          The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
          goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
          them.

                         DJANGO
          Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
          No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
          and get out of the south.

          - Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
          Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
          He sends her on her way.
          Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
          down hill heading back for the big house.

          EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
          The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
          back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
          LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
          CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
          STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
          normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress
          Miss Lara, holding her other hand.
          ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt
          Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself.
          LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself.
          BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with
          his hat, walks alone.
          BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both
          dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together.
          and finally,
          SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
          wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
          This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
          drinks.
          They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
          door.
          Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
          property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
          their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
          The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
          their way.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

          WHEN ...
          The front of The Big House

          EXPLODES!
          knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
          BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
          can't believe their eyes.

          WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
          hang in the air.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
          hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
          As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
          up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
          The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
          mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
          CUE cool MUSIC.
          STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
          ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
          BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
          In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
          ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
          MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
          CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
          The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
          ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
          around his waist.
          Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
          .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
          ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
          The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

          OUTFIT.
          STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
          JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
          standing there.
          He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
          at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
          rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
          the gun on his hip.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
          Wonder, Fear, and Hate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ICZ

          WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
          as she watches this.
          As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
          House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
          The black man in the cool green jacket says;

                         DJANGO
          I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
          You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
          niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

                         ACE WOODY
          I guess I shoulda'.

                         DJANGO
          Yes you should of.
          He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

                         DJANGO
          Everybody stand up!
          It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
          Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
          Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

          THEN...
          He tosses the rifle away.
          Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

          SHOWDOWN STANCE.
          EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
          Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
          DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
          at the ten people, and says;

                         DJANGO
          All black folks, take ten steps away from
          the white folks.
          DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

                         DJANGO
          Not you Stephen. You're right where you
          belong.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         163
          The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
          steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
          LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
          CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
          DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
          his pocket.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Let's see if you can handle this as well
          as you can my nuts?
          He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO EVERYBODY)
          Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
          BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

                         BROWN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Can I at least cock it for her?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
          and points it towards the ground.

                         BROWN
          (to Lara Lee)
          Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
          the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
          fast as you can.
          LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
          middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
          happen.

                         DJANGO
          (to the six)
          Make your play hillbillies.
          The MUSIC SWELLS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         16'F
          EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

          DJANGO ACE WOODY

                         STEPHEN MOGUY

                         BROWN CODY

                          LARA LEE
          The PEOPLE watching on the side:

          BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

          CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
          EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

          TILL...
          ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
          to raise his Derringer.
          But it's no contest.
          As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
          Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
          FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
          Stephen) standing in front of him.
          They all fall to grass in different ways..
          It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
          HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

                         FLASH ON
          DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
          to Dr.Schultz.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (SMILING)
          You know what they're going to call you,
          my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

          BACK TO SHOWDOWN
          DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
          down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
          Candyland front lawn.
          The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /65
          All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
          alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
          DJANGO sees this.
          The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
          He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
          He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
          It EXPLODES.
          Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
          blowing the limbs off of many of them.
          The LAWN is SILENT.
          DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
          Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
          satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
          He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
          putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
          wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
          As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

                         DJANGO
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Hey Big Trouble Maker.

                         DJANGO
          Down, boy.
          Timmy hops off of Tony.
          Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

                         DJANGO
          I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
          to me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes you did.

                         DJANGO
          Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll keep that in mind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Âï¿½66
          Django looks down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          Thanks for the help, boy.
          He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
          down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          That's for you. Good luck Tim.
          (he points to
          the Northern Sky)
          The North star, is that one.
          He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

                         DJANGO
          You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't wait for me.

                         DJANGO
          Better not.

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't.

                         DJANGO

                         (SMILING)
          Better not.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (SMILING)
          You won't.
          They kiss.
          Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
          Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
          Dragons.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP ï¿½ MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but ï¿½

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ï¿½ but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         ï¿½ yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl ï¿½ the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)
                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         I'll execute every one of you

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) ï¿½ MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
               seat are two young fellas ï¿½ one white, one black ï¿½ both 
               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                         ï¿½ Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause ï¿½ get a load of 
                         this ï¿½ if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man ï¿½ I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) ï¿½ MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT
                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES
                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD ï¿½ MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                                     JULES
                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) ï¿½ MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR ï¿½ MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses ï¿½ nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY ï¿½ MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                         ï¿½ no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages ï¿½ I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment ï¿½ he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage ï¿½ 
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed ï¿½ this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) ï¿½ MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be ï¿½

                                     JULES
                         ï¿½ I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions ï¿½

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black ï¿½

                                     JULES
                         ï¿½ go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald ï¿½

                                     JULES
                         ï¿½ does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               MEDIUM SHOT ï¿½ BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find ï¿½ when all 
                         this shit is over and done ï¿½ I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
                         motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
                         now you got ability. But painful as 
                         it may be, ability don't last. Now 
                         that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
                         life, but it's a fact of life your 
                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you 
                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 
                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                         Now the night of the fight, you may 
                         fell a slight sting, that's pride 
                         fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 
                         only hurts, it never helps. Fight 
                         through that shit. 'Cause a year 
                         from now, when you're kickin' it in 
                         the Caribbean you're gonna say, 
                         "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                     BUTCH
                         I got no problem with that.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         In the fifth, your ass goes down.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING) ï¿½ DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S ï¿½ DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S ï¿½ DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go ï¿½ for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) ï¿½ NIGHT

               CLOSEUP ï¿½ JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)
                         Vince, you can come in now!

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM ï¿½ NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

                                     LANCE
                         Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 
                         good stuff. This is Bava, different, 
                         but equally good. And this is Choco 
                         from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 
                         Now the first two are the same, forty-
                         five an ounce ï¿½ those are friend 
                         prices ï¿½ but this one...
                              (pointing to the Choco)
                         ...this one's a little more expensive.  
                         It's fifty-five. But when you shoot 
                         it, you'll know where that extra 
                         money went.  Nothing wrong with the 
                         first two. It's real, real, real, 
                         good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 
                         madman.

                                     VINCENT

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S ï¿½ NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT

                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA
                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                                     VINCENT
                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S ï¿½ NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY
                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 
                         or bloody as hell?

                                     VINCENT
                         Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 
                         vanilla coke.

                                     BUDDY
                         How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

                                     MIA
                         I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger ï¿½ 
                         bloody ï¿½ and a five-dollar shake.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 
                         Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

                                     MIA
                         Martin and Lewis.

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you just order a five-dollar 
                         shake?

                                     MIA
                         Sure did.

                                     VINCENT
                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh.

                                     VINCENT
                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him ï¿½

                                     MIA
                         What are you doing?

                                     VINCENT
                         Rollin' a smoke.

                                     MIA
                         Here?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist ï¿½ when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA
                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once ï¿½ at my wedding 
                         ï¿½ then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that 
                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)

                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME ï¿½ NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP ï¿½ MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE ï¿½ NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY
                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY
                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                                     LANCE
                         Get that black box in the bedroom I 
                         have with the adrenaline shot.

                                     JODY
                         What's wrong with her?

                                     VINCENT
                         She's ODing on us.

                                     JODY
                         Well get her the hell outta here!

                                     LANCE AND VINCENT
                              (in stereo)
                         Get the fuckin' shot!

                                     JODY
                         Don't yell and me!

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to Lance)

                         While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta 
                         get a medical book.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you need a medical book for?

                                     LANCE
                         To tell me how to do it. I've never 
                         given an adrenaline shot before.

                                     VINCENT
                         You've had that thing for six years 
                         and you never used it?

                         I never had to use it. I don't go 
                         joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all 
                         of my friends can handle their highs!

                                     VINCENT
                         Well then get it.

                         I am, if you'll let me.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

                         to her.

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

                         I'm looking as fast as I can!

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What's he lookin' for?

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What are you lookin' for?

                                     LANCE
                         My black medical book!

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY
                         Whata're you looking for?

                         My black fuckin' medical book. It's 
                         like a text book they give to nurses.

                                     JODY
                         I never saw a medical book.

                         Well if it's that important, why 
                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                                     JODY
                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room ï¿½

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         ï¿½ get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                     LANCE
                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                     VINCENT
                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                                     VINCENT
                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE
                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                         ï¿½ that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest ï¿½ SCREAMING.

               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                                     LANCE
                         If you're okay, say something.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA
                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                     JODY
                         Anybody want a beer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE ï¿½ NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT
                         What are your thoughts on how to 
                         handle this?

                                     MIA
                         What's yours?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA
                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                                     VINCENT
                         I seriously doubt that.

                                     MIA
                         If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                     VINCENT
                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
               shake and shake they do.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                                     MIA
                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 
                         FIVE" joke?

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT
                         I can't wait.

                                     MIA
                         Three tomatoes are walking down the 
                         street, a poppa tomato, a momma 
                         tomato, and a little baby tomato. 
                         The baby tomato is lagging behind 
                         the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 
                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the 
                         momma tomato and stamps on him ï¿½
                              (stamps on the ground)
                         ï¿½ and says: catch up.

               They both smile, but neither laugh.

                                     MIA
                         See ya 'round, Vince.

               Mia turns and walks inside her house.

               CLOSEUP ï¿½ VINCENT

               After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where 
               she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a 
               kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu 
               START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Butch.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM ï¿½ NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE
                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               We hear over the black and white title:

                                     SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
                         ï¿½ Well Dan, that had to be the 
                         bloodiest and, hands-down, the most 
                         brutal fight this city has ever seen.

               The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The 
               sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked 
               car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from 
               inside.

                                     SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
                         ...Coolidge was out of there faster 
                         than I've ever seen a victorious 
                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
                         he knew Willis was dead?

                                     SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I 
                         think any man would've left the ring 
                         that fast.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named 
               ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, 
               sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a 
               white styrofoam cup.

               The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

                                     SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
                         Do you feel this ring death tragedy 
                         will have an effect on the world of 
                         boxing?

                                     SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
                         Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 
                         help but shake the world of boxing 
                         to its very foundation. But it's of 
                         paramount importance that during the 
                         sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the 
                         W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the ï¿½

               CLICK ï¿½ Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (Spanish accent)
                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Where to?

                                     BUTCH
                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mia. How you doin'?

                                     MIA
                         Great. I never thanked you for the 
                         dinner.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table ï¿½ 
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio ï¿½ you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos ï¿½ is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man ï¿½

                                     BUTCH
                         ï¿½ I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news ï¿½ I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) ï¿½ NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM ï¿½ MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese ï¿½

                                     BUTCH
                         ï¿½ where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         ï¿½

                                     BUTCH
                         ï¿½ on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING) ï¿½ DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table ï¿½ on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET ï¿½ DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER ï¿½ DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY ï¿½ DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET ï¿½ BUTCH'S APARTMENT ï¿½ DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD ï¿½ DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal ï¿½ the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door ï¿½ nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT ï¿½ DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment ï¿½ neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY ï¿½ LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD ï¿½ DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA ï¿½ DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET ï¿½ DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA ï¿½ DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP ï¿½ DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         ï¿½

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me ï¿½

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         ï¿½ hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business ï¿½

                                     MAYNARD
                         ï¿½ I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM ï¿½ DAY

               TWO SHOT ï¿½ BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT ï¿½ BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP ï¿½ DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM ï¿½ DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM ï¿½ DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask ï¿½ two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP ï¿½ DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM ï¿½ DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET ï¿½ CHOPPER (MOVING) ï¿½ DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM ï¿½ DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good ï¿½

                                     BUTCH
                         ï¿½ did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk ï¿½ 
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)
                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM ï¿½ DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT ï¿½ DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT ï¿½ JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand ï¿½

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING ï¿½ MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING) ï¿½ MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES
                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules ï¿½

                                     JULES
                         ï¿½ I said don't do that ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         ï¿½ you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         ï¿½ chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         ï¿½ I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT
                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES
                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES
                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM ï¿½ DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN ï¿½ MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie ï¿½

                                     JIMMIE
                         ï¿½ I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him ï¿½

                                     JIMMIE
                         ï¿½ answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                         ï¿½ I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation ï¿½ 
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie ï¿½

                                     JIMMIE
                         ï¿½ don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM ï¿½ MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM ï¿½ MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE ï¿½ MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET ï¿½ MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE ï¿½ MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE ï¿½ MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN ï¿½ MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery ï¿½ now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie ï¿½ 
                         lead the way, boys ï¿½ get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM ï¿½ MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' ï¿½

                                     THE WOLF
                         ï¿½ Winston, Jimmie ï¿½ please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore ï¿½

                                     THE WOLF
                         ï¿½ let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE ï¿½ MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA ï¿½ MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD ï¿½ MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE ï¿½ MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless ï¿½

                                     THE WOLF
                         ï¿½ unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW ï¿½ MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES
                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON
                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT
                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES
                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP ï¿½ MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent ï¿½ no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be ï¿½ a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ ï¿½

                                     VINCENT
                         ï¿½ what happened was peculiar ï¿½ no 
                         doubt about it ï¿½ but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all ï¿½

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM ï¿½ MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP ï¿½ MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and ï¿½ sure enough ï¿½ there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
                         general principle.

                                     JULES
                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
               ï¿½ wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics ï¿½ walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
