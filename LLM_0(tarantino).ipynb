              "'ing credit sequence plays, complete with its own spaghetti western theme song, we see seven shirtless and shoeless black male slaves connected together with leg irons, being run, by two white male hillbillies on horseback. the location is somewhere in texas. the black men roy, big sid, benjamin, django, pudgy ralph, franklyn, and blueberry are slaves just recently purchased at the greenville slave auction in greenville mississippi. the white hillbillies are two slave traders called, the speck brothers ace and dicky. one of the seven slaves is our hero django... . hes fourth in the leg iron line. we may or may not notice a tiny small r burned into his cheek r for runaway, but we cant help but notice his back which has been slashed to ribbons by bull whip beatings. as the operatic opening theme song plays, we see a montage of misery and pain, as django and the other men are walked through blistering sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. bare feet step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. leg irons take the skin off ankles. as the credits play, django has a spaghetti western flashback. now spaghetti western flashbacks are never pretty, its usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past. in this instance we see django in a slave pen at the greenville auction. django amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the cell door, his wife broomhilda being led to the auction block. he fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance, he can see broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he hears the auctioneer yell sold. then shes taken away to whereabouts unknown, never to be seen again. as the sun continues to beat down on djangos head, he remembers django in the slave pen with what seems like a one hundred and fifty slaves in a cell designed for forty. white men yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the structure. the ground floor is covered by the big money buyers who stand in front of the auction block. 2 django is moved into a line of slaves the black men, and their masters their white owners, and their sellers the white man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction block, as they wait for their turn on the block. a slave robbie, stand on the auction block in view of the room full of buyers, the seller sells, and the owners stand off to the side. django takes in the environment around him. django has never cared for white folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly. its djangos turn on the auction block as the theme song wails its tragic crescendo, django is brought up on the auction block. he.looks down at all the white people who want to buy niggers, who look up to him. his heart fills with poison. back to django walking in leg irons with his six other companions, walking across the blistering texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking.  .hating. the opening credit sequence end.  ext  woods  night its night time and the speck brothers, astride horses, keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward. its a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to create a little top light. its so dark, the slavers use the creek.bed to keep from getting lost. both speck brothers carry a lantern up on their horse, as. does roy, the slave in lead position on the chain gang. its also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves, two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. in fact the seven chained together slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison, resemble a human locomotive. the slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both speck brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white fur collars. when... .a sound and a small light appears ahead of them on the road. this makes the slave traders stop their human live stock, and ready their rifles for possible trouble. 3 a black horse carrying a dressed in grey rider, clipclops from the background to the foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the rider carries. the rider appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. a long grey wintercoat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler hat on his head. dicky speck whos that stumblin around in the dark state your business, or prepare to get winged the rider calm yourselves gentlemen, i mean you no harm. im simply a fellow weary traveler. the rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two slavers, and their slaves, lifting the lantern up to his face. he speaks with a slight german accent. the rider to the slavers good cold evening gentlemen. to the shivering slaves good eveningim looking for a pair of slave traders that go by thename of the speck brothers. might that be you ace speck who wants to. know the rider i do. im dr. king schultz, and this is my horse, fritz. fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught him. dicky speck you a doctor dr.schultz affirmative. dicky speck what kinda doctor dr.schultz dentist. are you the speck brothers, and did you purchase those men at the greenville.slave auction ace speck so what le dr.schultz so, i wish to parley with you. ace speck speak english dr.schultz oh, im sorry. please forgive me, it is a second language. amongst your inventory, ive been led to believe, is a specimen im keen to acquire. to the slaves hello you poor devils. is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of the carrucan plantation since roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. in the darkness a voice rings out djangos voice os im from the carrucan plantation. dr.schultz moves fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his lantern, illuminating our hero django. dr.schultz splendid and whats your name young, man django django. dr.schultz wunderbar youre exactly the one im looking for. so tell me django  by the way thats a amazing name  during your time at the carrucan plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of the brittle brothers django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz is delighted. dr.schultz big john, ellis, and little brother raj django dem da brittle brothers. dr.schultz so django, do you think you could recognize  . the speck brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief. ace speck hey, stop talkin to him like that dr.schultz like what ace spec like that dr.schultz my good man, im simply trying to ascertain ace speck speak english, goddamit dr.schultz everybody calm down im simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction. ace speck i dont care, no sale. now off wit ya dr.schultz dont be ridiculous, of course theyre for sale. ace raises his rifle towards the german. ace speck move it ace cocks back the rifle hammer. dr.schultz my good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention... ace speck last chance, fancy pants dr.schultz  very well  the doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in darkness. the next flash of light we see is the good doctors pistol out of his holster, and firing point blank into ace specks face... .blowing the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt. before dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the germans direction... bam... dr.schultz shoots his horse in the head... .the steed goes down taking dicky with him... when the dead weight horse lands on dickys slightly twisted leg, we hear two distinct cracking sounds... dicky lets out a bitch like scream. the slaves watch all this. theyve never seen a white man kill another white man before. dicky is pinned down under his ole paint. django watches in the dark, the german climb down off his horse, pick up aces discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining speck. dr.schultz sorry about putting a bullet in your beast. but i didnt want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses. dr.sch.ultz lights the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over dickys body. dicky speck you goddamn son of a bitch, you killed ace dr.schultz. i only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me. and i do believe i have ... counting out the slaves .one, two, three, four, five, six, seven witnesses who can attest to that fact. dicky speck my damn legs busted dr.schultz no doubt. now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, id like to finish my line of inquiry with young django. to django as i was saying, if you were to see the brittle brothers again, would you recognize them django yes. dr.schultz now im sure. to you, all unshaven white men look alike. so django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out the brittle brothers django spaghetti western flashback were in his little shack at the carrucan plantation. its pissing rain outside. django is making love to his wife broomhilda, when she stops letting out a shout. the three overseers known as the brittle brothers are outside peeking in through the window. they burst in through the front door. soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement. as django and broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze her tit. . .they bring a belt across djangos backside to make him fuck faster. . .then they yank him off, as big john climbs on top of broomhilda..the other brittle brothers whip django with their belts, and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife. back to django django i can point em out. dr.schultz sold american so mr.speck, how much for django dicky speck im gonna lose this leg dr.schultz yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, im afraid that will be the. end result. but back to business, how much do you want for django dicky speck you go to hell dr.schultz dont be silly. how much for django dicky speck 800 dollars dr.schultz oh come now, i may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was i born yesterday. 8 the. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket. dr.schultz in this most helpful pamphlet that i picked up at the greenville slave auction, it says that the going rate for african flesh  in particularly a field nigger is sixty to eighty dollars. now handsome no doubt as django is, technically, he is a field. nigger. which according tothis pamphlet here  and why would they lie  puts his price at eighty dollars. so in light of that, how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young django here. dr.schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver. dr.schultz and since your late brother. wont be using it anymore, id like to purchase his nag. he removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on dickys body. he bends down and, puts the paper money.in the saddle bags on dickys dead horse. with.his hands in there, he roots around and finds the keys tothe leg irons. he unlocks djangos leg irons. django is free. dr.schultz there you go django,. give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. also, if i was you, id take that winter coat the dear departed speck left behind. django removes the coat from the dead slaver. puts on the warm jacket over his bare back, and climbs up on ace specks horse. dr.schultz turns to dicky on the ground. dr.schultz mr.speck, i am afraid i will require a bill of sale. do you have one dicky just curses him. he says, removing a notebook from his pocket dr.schultz i thought not. no worries, i come prepared. as he writes this will serve nicely as a bill of sale. he stops, then says to django django is spelled with a silent d, is it not 9 django huh dr.schultz why not.. he writes it in his book with a silent d, then stops to admire the way it looks. dr.schultz yes, that does add a little character. the german dentist lowers himself by the speck brother pinned down under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen. dr.schultz if youd be so kind speck, as to make your mark here. the. hillbilly spits in the german gentlemans face. the good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief. then takes out a pocket knife. and whispers something that cant be heard in the slavers ear. he signs the bill of sale. dr.schultz mr.speck, i would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired. the good doctor climbs back up on fritz, and looks to the six slaves, in leg irons. dr.schultz now as to you poor devils. he tosses to pudgy ralph the keys to the shackles. dr.schultz so as i.see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices. one, once im gone, you lift that beast off the remaining speck, then carry him to the nearest town. which would be at least thirtyseven miles back the way you came. or ... .two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. the choice is yours. hes just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds 0 dr.schultz oh, and on the off chance that theres any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the north star is that one. tata. he looks to django, who doesnt know how to start his horse. dr.schultz just give him a little kick. django does, and the horse responds by moving. dr.schultz see, its not so difficult. ext  morning texas landscape  sunrise the dawn breaks on a western landscape. the two men ride their horses silently, horse hooves clipclopping among the rocks. django wears specks winter coat, with one of dr.schultzs white button down dress shirts underneath it. as they ride through the picturesque scene... dr.schultz breaks the silence. dr.schultz so, django, what do you intend to name him django who dr.schultz your horse django what horse dr.schultz the horse youre riding. django this aint my horse. dr.schultz yes it is. django no it aint, its your horse. im just riding it. dr.schultz well, technically, yes  wait a minute  technically not. if its my horse, i can give it to you, and as of now, im doing such. django, youre now the proud owner of a horse, congratulations. 1 django i cant feed no horse. i cant put no horse up in no stable. dr.schultz frustrated dont worry about all that they ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself... then says with a smile dr.schultz so... . now that thats settled... . what do you intend to name it half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name. for instance my steed is named fritz. hes stubborn, ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but i couldnt do without him. he pats fritzs neck anyway, the name of ones steed, isnt something one does lightly. so once youve thought about it for awhile  django  tony. dr.schultz  tony what django  i dunno, tony the horse. dr.schultz oh, you mean you want to name your horse tony django yeah. thats what you jus asked me, right dr.schultz when youre right youre right, indeed i did. why tony django i gotta tell ya you didnt tell me i gotta tell ya. as they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a western town. they pass by a sign that says welcome to daughtrey, texas z dr.schultz well im naturally curious, of course, but theres no reason you must tell me. in fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed. and i do believe tony wears it well. good job django, well done. ext  the western town of daughtrey  morning as the citizens of daughtrey wake up, django and dr.schultz ride fritz and tony through the main street of town..daughtrey looks like a million western towns weve seen before in movies. but to the townspeople of daughtrey, django and the german dont look like a million other visitors. dr.schultz whats everybody staring at django they never seen a nigger on a horse before. dr.schultz whats this bizarre obsession they have with. you not riding horses django you askin me dr.schultz stops fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. django has a little trouble both stopping tony and getting off him, but it gets done. dr.schultz keeps bombarding the slave with questions. dr.schultz so what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in as per usual with this white man, django thinks what dr.schultz im just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you cant do, and if you cant do it, why cant you do it like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it would the authorities frown on that django hell yeah, they gonna frown. dr.schultz what part would they find the most offensive 13 django all of it. i cant be walkin in no saloon. i cant be sittin my ass on no chair, at no table. i cant be drinkin no drink. and i definitely cant be sharin no drink, with no white man, in public. dr.schultz so if you and i did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff django you bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff. the good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance. dr.schultz well in that case django, after you. django whoa  i aint funnin, i cant go in there. dr.schultz django youre going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said theres no time like the,present. he takes django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment. int  saloon  morning the nervous black slave and the confident germandentist walk into the saloon. the saloon keeper pete is high up on a chair placed high up on a table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. his back is turned away from the two patrons. dr.schultz good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers. saloon keeper it,s still pretty early, we wont be open for about a hour. but by then well be servin breakfast  he turns around and sees them. saloon keeper whoa what the hell you think you doin boy, get that nigger outta here. it time cut ext  saloon  morning its about five minutes later, and the saloon keeper comes running out of the bar to get the sheriff. when dr.schultz, sitting at a table with the young django, calls dr.schultz inn keeper remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall. this wouldnt be the marshalls jurisdiction.this is just a infraction, on what i assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the sheriff. the saloon keeper runs away. the two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon. dr.schultz it looks like we must act as our own bartender. the german stands up, and walksbehind the bar, and pours two beers from the tap into mugs. django remains seated, and after a beat, asks django what kinda dentist are you this makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beers. dr.schultz i havent practiced dentistry in five years  not to say once i know you better, i wouldnt like to get a look at that mouth  im sure its a disaster  but these days i practice a new profession ... . bounty hunter. this gets no reaction from django. dr.schultz do you know what a bounty hunter is the black man shakes his head, no. as the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer, he explains dr.schultz well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses. 15 dr.schultz contd the state places a bounty on a mans head. i track that man, i find that man, i kill that man. after ive killed him, i transport that mans corpse back to the authorities  and sometimes thats easier said then done. i show that corpse to the authorities  proving, yes indeed, i have truly killed him  at which point, the authorities pay me the bounty. lifting his beer cheers. the two men touch glasses, and take a drink. django whats a bounty dr.schultz its like a reward. django you kill people and they give you a reward dr.schultz certain people, yes. django white people dr.schultz mostly. a few mexicans. couple chinamen. django bad people dr.schultz badder they are, bigger the reward. which brings me to you, and i must admit im at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you. on one hand, i despise slavery. on the other hand, i need your help, and if youre not in a position to refuse, all the better. so for the time being, im going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit. beat still... . having said that, .i feel guilty. so... id like the two of us to enter into an agreement. im looking for the brittle brothers, however in this endeavor im at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, i dont know what they look like. but you do... .dontcha 1g . django spaghetti western flashback django, back at the carrucan plantation, held down by roger and ellis brittle, as big john burns the r into his cheek with a branding iron. back to django django i know what they look like, all right. dr.schultz good. so, heres my agreement. you travel with me till we find them  django  where we goin dr.schultz i hear at least two of them are overseeing up in gatlinburg, but i dont know where. that means we visit every plantation in gatlinburg till we find them. and when we find them, you point them out, and i kill them. you do that, i agree to give you your freedom... . twentyfive dollars per brittle brother  thats seventyfive dollars... . your horse, tony even though ive already gave him to you  but once the final brittle brother lies dead in the dust, ill buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included. dr.schultzs eyes go to the saloon window. dr.schultz and as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff. ext  saloon  morning we see the sheriff, bill sharp, walk towards the saloon cradling a winchester. some townspeople like the saloon keeper stand around to watch. a. young boy leads a herd of baby goats through town. sheriff sharp stands in the middle of the street. sheriff sharp okay boys, funs over, come on out. both the doctor and django stand up and walk to the front porch. as they do, the sheriff says 1 2 sheriff sharp now why yall wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people you aint got nothin better to do, then to come into bill sharps town and show your ass  from his top step on the porch, dr. king schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... . .then... a small derringer  pops into schultzs hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. once in hand, the dentist fires one tiny bullet into the belly of bill sharp. the tiny gun makes a tiny pop sound. the shocked bill sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the dirt. the townspeople are startled. as is django. as schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading his tiny pop shooter, a pedestrian yells out pedestrian what did you jus do to our sheriff dr.schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law mans skull, killing him dead. in the background, one woman faints. the boy and his goats scatter. dr.schultz looks over at the saloon keeper, across the street. dr.schultz now you can go get the marshall. time cut ext  daughtrey main street  day u.s.marshall gill tatum snaps the menfolk of daughtrey to attention. marshall tatum move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon. and i want six men and six winchesters behind it. and i want two men with two rifles on this roof, and two men with two rifles on that roof, with all barrels pointed at that front door. and somebody git poor bill outta the goddamn street. lp cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon. the marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place. the last sniper on the rooftop takes his position. when... coming from the saloon... . piano music ... int  saloon  day dr.schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number. he seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player. a terrified django, whos sure his new master is a lunatic whos going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains on the window. dr.schultzs suit coat sits draped over a chair. all of his weapons, including his metal sliding rail derringer contraption, lie on a table. he plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest. dr.schultz what are they doing django i think they wonderin why you playin the piana. dr.schultz good. pause but what are they doing django a buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front, now they hidin behind it with guns. and a buncha other white folks are up on

dr.schultz fair enough marshall, here we.come. dr.schultz to django theyre a little tense out there. so dont make any quick movements, and let me do the talking. django looks at him like, as if... ext  saloonmain street  day a lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon. outside of range, the whole town watches the stand off. the saloon doors open, and dr.schultz and django, hands raised, step outside. marshall tatum you unarmed dr.schultz yes indeed we are. marshall tatum, may i address you, your deputies, and apparently the entire town of daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred marshall tatum go on dr.schultz my name is dr.king schultz. and like yourself, marshall, i am a servant of the court. the man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of bill sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of willard peck, with a price on his head of two hundred dollars. thats two hundred dollars, dead or alive. marshall tatum the hell you say dr.schultz i.m aware this is probably disconcerting news. but im willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years. i know this because. three years ago he was rustling cattle from, the b.c. corrigan cattle company of lubbock texas. z dr.schultz contd in my possession. is a warrant made out by circuit court judge henry allen laudermilk of austin texas. you are encouraged to wire him. he will back up who i am, and who your dear departed sheriff was. the menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. then dr.schultz delivers the coup de grace. dr.schultz in other words marshall, you owe me two hundred dollars. cut to ext  tennessee country road  day django and dr.schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles together, ride their horses in the tennessee countryside, on the way to gatlinburg. dr.schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey business suits, and django is still dressed in his slave pants, schultzs button down dress shirt, and ace specks winter coat. somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared onhis feet. dr.schultz one needs a plan, son. these are brutal times. a man who survives, is a man with a plan. a man who thrives, is a man with a good plan. so, having said that, whats your plan, young django django whatcha mean dr.schultz well, after this brittle business is behind us, youll be a free man, with a horse, and seventy five dollars in your back pocket. whats your plan after that django find my wife, and buy her freedom. dr.schultz django, i had no idea you were a married man. do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously django huh zz dr.schultz do slaves believe in marriage django me and my wife do. dr.schultz where is she now django i dunno. they put us in different boxcars, and sent u.s to the greenville slave auction. she got sold two days fore me. but i dont know who to. dr.schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky. dr.schultz care for some jerky django sure. dr.schultz rips him off a piece. django chews on it. as he chews, schultz says dr.schultz so your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and purchase her.freedom only you dont know where she is a chewing django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a moment contemplating the dilemma, then pronounces dr.schultz well that shouldnt be all that difficult. so how long ago did all this happen django a few months ago. dr.schultz three or four django three. dr.schultz so shecamefrom the carrucan plantation, and shewassold at the greenville slave auctiontosome unknown customer three monthsago django nods his head, yes. z3 dr.schultz the bad part about slavery being a business, is its immoral. the good part about it being a business is, they keep records. somewhere in greenville theres a book with your wifes name in it, and the name of the customer who bought her, and more then likely their address. but then schultz seems to get second thoughts. dr.schultz still, seventyfive dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but its not going to get you very far in greenville. not to mention a slave auction town in mississippi isnt the safest place you could visit. free or not. django ill have my freedom papers. dr.schultz yes you will. but say you show them to some rascals, and they take them from you and tear them up django they could do that dr.schultz im not saying they would, but they could. django they do that ill kill em. dr.schultz great now you get hung for killin a white man. the point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you. django well i gotta go, when do i go dr.schultz when you get more dangerous. ext  chattanooga  day muddy and wet big city chattanooga. were in the back of a store that. sells servanthouse nigger uniforms. django comes bursting out of the stores back door. hes very distressed. one glance at the outfit hes wearing explains the distress. z django is dressed in a powder blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit, that wouldnt be out of place in the court of marie antoinette at versailles. dr.schultz comes trailing after him. dr.schultz django, you have to, its part of the act. youre playing a character. your character is the valet. this is what the valet wears. remember what i told you. during the act, you can never break character. cut to ext  bennett manor day we see dr. schultz, riding slightly in front of django, dressed in his blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of bennett manor, a plantation in gatlinburg, tennessee. django leads a riderless horse, behind him and tony. as the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of bennett manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the slaves stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight. the patriarch of bennett manor, spencer big daddy bennett, dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground. while there are plenty black males out in the cotton fields, the majority of the slave population of bennett manor is pretty.black females, fourteen to twentyfour, referred to as, ponys. the biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton. as dr.schultz and fancy pants django, bring fritz and tony to a stop in front of bennett manor, theyve drawn quite a crowd of slaves, bennett family members, and white workers overseers. spencer bennett keeps on the top step so he wont be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse. spencer bennett its against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory. dr.schultz this is my valet, and my valet doesnt walk. spencer bennett i said niggers  z .ate dr.schultz his name is django, hes a free man, and he can ride what he pleases. spencer bennett not on my.property, around my niggers he cant. dr.schultz my good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot. allow me to unring this bell. my name is dr.king schultz, this is my valet, django, and these are our horses, fritz, and tony. fritz, does his head bow. this makes the pretty ponys surrounding bennett, giggle. dr.schultz mr. bennett, ive been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man. and it is in these capacities that weve ridden from texas to tennessee to talk with you now. spencer bennett state your business. dr.schultz i wish to purchase one of your nigger gals. spencer

drink. the incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does django. then the good doctor walks up the steps to bennett manor. dr.schultz maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort django here around your magnificent grounds. spencer absolutely. betina a pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twentytwo year old slave gal named betina, snaps to

bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself. spencer understood., schultz. betina betina yes, sir spencer django isnt a slave. django is a free man. do you understand youre not

gummy mouth bitches out in the field. but the lion share of my lady niggers are real show ponys. dr.schultz well thats what im looking for, a show pony for young django. so the only question that remains is, do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars spencer dr.schultz, five thousand dollar nigger, is practically my middle name. back to django and betina betina and django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds. the cotton fields and the slaves picking it, in the background. django betina, come over here, i need to ask you something. he moves her by the tree for more privacy. betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all loveydovey, and she couldnt be less interested. betina whatcho want django im lookin for three white men. three brothers. overseers. their name

of em out to me betina well ones over in that field. she points to the cotton field, at a overseer on top of a horse, whip in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy. django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and takes out a shiny brass spyglass, the type a sea captain might use. obviously a prop from dr.schultz. he slides it open, places it against his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton field landscape. spyglass pov astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself shaffer, but who django knows to be ellis brittle, looks on, oblivious to djangos observation. django spaghetti western flashback he remembers ellis brittle burning a r into broomhildas cheek with a branding iron. back to django and the spyglass he lowers the

his left at the sounds of the voice. big john turns toward django, who he still doesnt recognize. django just stares back. big john smile disappears. he recognizes django. so does roger. little raj django django crosses toward big john, raising up his arm like hes going to shake his hand ... django remember me .django extends his arm, and dr.schultzs derringer arm contraption,. pops the tiny gun into his hand, and he fires a tiny bullet smack dab into big johns merciless heart. big john face goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his heart, at django. django i like the way you die, boy. 3 3 big john hears it...then tips over dead. little jody cant believe what shes just seen. four other slaves who just happen to be walking in the background, see it. little raj is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip, but since hes no gunman, in his haste, he gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground. it goes off... bang. shooting himself in the foot, he hops up and down in pain. the bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the bang. django picks big johns whip off the ground., and begins whipping little raj across the face and chest. more slaves gather. django whips him to the ground whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks rogers pistol off the ground, and empties it five shots into

brittle, and roger brittle  django  they were goin by the name, shaffer. dr.schultz you know them by the name, shaffer. but the butchers real nameswere brittle. these are wanted men. the law wants them for murder. i reiterate, this warrant states dead or alive. when django and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal. boundaries. now i realize passions are high. but i must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is, you will be hung by the neck until you are dead. this does put a momentary pause in the lynch mobs blood lust. after his dramatic pause for effect... .dr.schultz says dr.schultz may i please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it resting his winchester over his shoulder, bennett reaches for the paper. spencer gimmie. dr.schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to the plantation owner. bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned

anyway, her father is really mad at her. django what she do. dr.schultz i dont exactly remember. i think she disobeys him in some way. so at first hes just going to obliterate her  django obliterate... . what does that mean dr.schultz like blow up. he pantomimes a explosion. django phew, thats pretty mad. dr.schultz yes it is, and like most fathers, given a little time, he calms down a bit. hes still mad at her. he still wants to punish her. just not ... . blow her up. so instead what he does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain. django broomhildas on a mountain dr.schultz its a german legend, theres always going to be a mountain in there somewhere. so, he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain. and. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire. and there broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her. django does a fella arise from now on as dr.schultz talks, hes beginning to realize something he wasnt aware of when the conversation started. dr.schultz yes django, as a matter he does. a fella named, sigfried. django does sigfried save her dr.schultz yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so. now true, he is assisted in his triumph by a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having said that, sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to his courage. he scales the mountain, because hes not afraid of it. he defeats the dragon, because hes not afraid.of him. dr.schultz cont he walks through hellfire because broomhildas worth. it. after that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches. django i know how he feels. dr.schultz i think im just starting to realize that. he pours django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he thinks about what hes going to say next. dr.schultz look django, i dont doubt one day you will save your lady love. but im afraid i cant let you go to greenville in a good conscious. let me ask you a question, how do you like the bounty hunting business django kill white folks, and they pay ya whats not to like dr.schultz i hafta admit, we make a good team. django but ithought you were mad at me for killin big john and rodger dr.schultz yes, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous. but normally, thats a good thing. howd you like to partner up for the winter django whatd ya mean partner up dr.schultz you be my deputy, for real this time. a lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs. some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece. with one man, anything over three men is a risk. but with a partner creating cross fire its fish in a. barrel. a lot of these gangs hold up in thehills for the winter. django you makin another agreement w7 dr.schultz yes. you work with me through the winter, till the snow melts. i give you a third of my bounties. and while were together, ill teach you a few things youre going to need to know. django can you teach me how to make tony do that head bow thing that fritz can do dr.schultz that among other things. we make some money this winter, when the snow melts, ill take you to greenville myself, and well find where they sent your wife. im pretty good at finding people. is it a deal no white man has ever done anything for django, just to him. so understandably, hes a little suspicious. django why you care what happens to me why you care if i find my wife dr.schultz well frankly, ive never given anybody their freedom before. and now that i have, i feel vaguely responsible for you. youre just not ready to go off on your own, its that simple. youre too green, youll get hurt. plus when a german meets a real life sigfried,. its kind of a big deal. as a german, im obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved broomhilda. django accepts that response. what follows is a montage covering the five months that django and schultz partner up as bounty hunters. schultz wears his normal ensemble. django wears his cool looking green jacket, unless its really cold, which a lot of this montage is. then he still wears ace specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes. we see a scene to be improvised more or less, where dr.schultz teaches django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip. by the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see djangos going to be good at this. ext  hillside  sunny day we see django and dr.schultz walking up a hill. tony and fritz have been left tied up downhill. django leads a extra body horse named poncho behind him. dr.schultz carries his scope sight rifle in a long case. they get to the top of the hill. it overlooks a small farmhouse. y, 8 down below we see a little man struggling behind a plow, and his fifteen year old son helping him by leading the horse forward. on top of their perch on the hill top, dr.schultz says dr.schultz keep down or hell see you. django who that farmer who cares dr.schultz well since we came here to kill em, he just might. django what the little man pushin that plow dr.schultz that little man pushing that plow, is smitty bacall. django smitty bacall is a farmer dr.schultz no. smitty bacall is a stagecoach robber whos hiding out as a farmer, because theres a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head. he hands django the scope rifle case. dr.schultz and hes all yours my boy. django lays on his belly, with the scope sight up to his eye. scope sight pov on the farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse and his son. djangos finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates. dr.schultz oh what happened.to mister i wanna kill white folks for money django his sons with him. dr.schultz good. hell have a loved one with him. maybe even share a last word. thats better then most get, and a damn. sight better then he deserves. 19 django still hesitates. dr.schultz put down the rifle. dont worry, im not mad at you. take out smitty bacalls handbill. django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants. dr.schultz read it aloud. consider it todays lesson. django reading wanted, dead or alive. smitty bacall and the smitty bacall gang. for murder and stagecoach robbery. seven thousand dollars for smitty bacall. one thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members. known members of the smitty bacall gang are as follows, dandy michaels, gerald nash, and crazy craig koons. dr.schultz well done. bravo. that is who smitty bacall is. if smitty bacall wanted to start a farm at twentytwo, they would never of printed that. referring to the handbill but smitty bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didnt mind killing people to do it. you want to save your wife by doing what i do this is what i do. i kill people, and sell their corpses for cash. his corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him. django shoots. the little man down below behind the plow falls down. the young boy doesnt know what happened at first. then he figuresout his father was just shot. he goes to him in the dirt. dr.schultz you need to keep that smitty bacall handbill. django why dr.schultz its good luck. you always keep the handbill of your first bounty. they begin walking down the hill, to collect smitty bacalls body, leading the extra body horse behind them. 50 as they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of smitty bacalls son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies. dr.schultz see, theyre having a tender little father son moment now. no doubt the most heartfelt one theyve ever had. ext  snowy forest  night its now full on snowy winter in the hills. django practices his quick draw against a snowman hes built. he sticks a bottle in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowmans heart would be. he draws... shoots the bottle heart he draws ... shoots the left coal eye. he draws ... shoots the right coal eye. he draws... shoots the carrot nose. dr.schultz comes up behind him. dr.schultz i think its safe to say youre faster then the snowman. ext  snowy forest  different night a outlaw gang known as the wilson  lowe gang five guys ride through a snowy forest at night. when all five men and their horses, are shot from above. django and schultz up in a tree, firing down on them. ext  winter mountain town main street  night the flakes continue to fall hard as dr.schultz and django ride down the main street of town, pulling poor poncho whos fully loaded down with five corpses. 571 the local sheriff, don gus, watches the two men ride up, he knows them. sheriff gus doctor and django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there dr.schultz the wilson  lowe gang. sheriff gus who the hells the wilson  lowe gang dr.schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands it down to the friendly peace officer. dr.schultz bad chuck wilson, and meaner bobby lowe. and three of their acolytes. sheriff gus just leave em out here, they aint going nowhere. and ifin they do, god must love em, so who are we to say. come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee. tnt  sheriff guss office  night the snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office. they exchange pleasantries about the weather as the sheriff pours them coffee. after the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid, they get down to business. as schultz and gus discuss the bounties, django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. on the third one he reads, warren vanders, and a two thousand dollar bounty, that one, schultz says. django rips it off the wall. as the winter has progressed, we see theyve become a genuine bounty hunting team. and django, a genuine bounty hunter. ext  pretty meadow  day the snow has melted, and its spring. and inside of this meadow django practices his fast draw against five men... .by schultz throwing five coins in the air ... django draws fast shoots three coins, fires again hitting another, then falls to the ground to get the fifth. he looks up from the ground at schultz. 5l as schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says dr.schultz youre pretty confident arent you django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz you have reason to be. he holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm. all the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. he drops them on top of django. django still think im too green for greenville dr.schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says dr.schultz oh youre ready for greenville. he lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says dr.schultz greenville ready for you, that im not so sure. he blows out the match... we go to black what we also saw in the above montage is django shake off a lifetime of slavery. django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his steed tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man. hes not a slave anymore. hes a bounty hunter. black title card across the screen one letter at a time style ala rocky and flashdance mississippi cut to ext  the town of greenville mississippi  day the whole main street of greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other. 53 we see django and dr.schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in the mud,, down the main street of greenville mississippi. the buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around. black men, women, and children in bondage are everywhere you look. lines of chained slaves being marched one way or the other, move through the muddy streets of greenville. white men on horses move them along. buckboards filled with domestic slaves house niggers, and pretty ponys, driven by white men roll through the street. a young white boy 14 years old, a shepherd, leads a bunch of slave children through town. a shepherds dog, helps him out by moving the kids along. impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block. a subtitle appears on the bottom of the screen greenville chickasaw county, mississippi dr.schultz takes in this african flesh market, where human beings sell other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock. django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how greenville operates. as he rides tony through town in his snappy duds, he looksat the black men half dressed in chains. he remembers himself with his six other companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of main street by the speck brothers. on that day he might as well of been a steer. today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy outfit, astride his steed tony, he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill. django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge slave pen, like a steer corral. at the moment theres no train in the depot. we flash on the train, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot. inside one of the boxcars amidst a boxcar full of shirtless black males, django watches the train pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar. a hatch in the roof of the boxcar is noisily yanked open, and two white slave traders russ and judd, peer down at their human cargo. judd good god almighty these niggers stink i f russ niggers stink, wheres the shock to the slaves below okay you bucks, listen up, and listen well, im only gonna say this once. theres a slave corral right across from this boxcar. we gittin ready to open these doors. when we do, yall run as fast as you can, right into that pen. anyone gittin off trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. now you niggers better comprehend. and that goes for any african garboons amongst yall cant understand english ... . your american buddies better shove your ass in the right direction, or your trip to this country is going to be short, and pointless. train to pen as fast as you can the boxcar door is slid open, and a hundred and fifty black males run full out from the train to the steer corral. we spot django during the running. once inside the corral, the gate is closed. cowboys with rifles act as prison guards. inside the corral through the wooden posts, in the distance, django watches them open up the boxcar holding the females. they do their run to their pen out of view. django catches a quick glimpse of broomhild.a running with the other ladies, then shes gone from view. back to django present django and dr.schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of greenville. dr.schultz its a spectacle out of dante. django you should see it from the other side. dr.schultz frankly, i dont know if i could endure this. django youd be surprised what you can endure. beat where to 675 dr.schultz records office. cut to int  records office  day dr.schultz and django walk into a records office, lined with books. we watch through the store front window, the black man and white man enter, and dr.schultz present his business card to a dickensian looking records office worker. as schultz starts his spellbinding with words routine... . the camera fades to black. black title card broomhilda int  slave pen  day the same shot we saw before of django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen, to get a better last look of broomhilda. broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance. then, as before django loses sight of her. ext  main street  greenville  day we follow in front of broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by two white male slavers. her bare feet slosh in the main street mud, and the leg irons scrap her ankles. up until now everything youve ever seen of broomhilda, has only been in djangos spaghetti western flashbacks. in other words, from his perspective, and memory. this is the,only time the story will shift to broomhildas perspective. the strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of main street. broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that django was sold in at the beginning. instead shes just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon. her seller clyde starts his pitch on the twelve or so buyers that watch this puny make shift auction. broomhilda looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her breath which one will buy her. among the ugly white men we see mr.harmony mike, not quite as ugly as the rest. an older well dressed, classy gentleman. next to him is his twenty four year old overweight awkward son scotty harmony. scotty in the audience, and broomhilda on the wagon, their eyes meet, he nudges his dad. the seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. then her back, revealing her whip marks. then pointing out the runaway r branded in her cheek. some of the crowd, including scotty, react with repulsion at the sight of the whip marks. the seller assures the crowd, that niggers dont feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle. seller  clyde fellahs, you aint felt gentle, till you felt nigger gal gentle. ugly man makes a bid. broomhilda yikes. uglier man higher bid. broomhilda reacts. uglier by far guy makes leap frog big bid. broomhilda reacts. big greasy fat guy makes a bid. big fat greasy beaver pelt covered trapper makes a bid. a giggling leering group of brothers make a bid. a seventy five year old indian on a mule makes a bid. mr.harmony makes a bid for his son scotty. broomhilda notices that. and makes more eye contact with scotty. they look at each other as mr.harmony continues to bid. a literary narrator comes on the soundtrack. narrator vo on that day, eight months ago, the auction was won by mike harmony, as a birthday present for his fat boy son scotty. mr.harmony congratulates his son. from on top of the buckboard broomhilda looks down at her new owners. later they leave for the harmony house. scotty lifts broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard. he hands her a little white bag. scotty this is for you. she opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it. scotty theyre jelly beans. try one. she selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth. scotty good huh she nods her head, yes. we see him drive the buckboard out of greenville with broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans. xt  country road  day the buckboard makes its way down a country road. broomhilda in the back, and scotty driving the wagon. scotty bought her, but hes too scared to talk to her. broomhildas muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. shes beginning to realize the young master is the shy type. broomhilda master scotty...  scotty yes broomhilda broomhilda im lonely back here. can i come on up with you on that seat so we can talk scotty please, id love that. she climbs into the drivers seat. in more ways then one. 8 ext  the harmony house  day a nice two story southern house. very nice, but hardly a plantation. the households four domestic slaves. broomhilda will be the fifth. the buckboard pulls up to the front of the house. scottys mother, mrs.harmony mary louise, waits to meet her son, and his new bought nigger gal. the older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her mrs.harmony whats your name, gal broomhilda broomhilda. mrs.harmony follow me. into the kitchen, to her son you stay out here. int  kitchen  day mrs.harmony brings broomhilda in her kitchen. the two domestic slaves that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. mrs.harmony grabs broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her mrs.harmony i want to have a word with you, wench. you met my boy scotty. you can tell aint no white girl gonna fool with him. and if they do fool with him, they fool with him for the wrong reason. boys twenty four, he still aint a man yet. thats why youre here. be nice to him. hes a very sweet boy. play him right, hell eat bird seed out of your palm. play em wrong, youll deal with me. broomhilda i like scotty. hes just shy is all. all he needs is a little confidence. mrs.harmony and youll give that to him broomhilda ill do my best, mam. scottys a real sweet boy. mrs.harmony he is, isnt he broomhilda ahhuh. the mother lets go of the young ladys wrist. 19 narrator vo basically the harmonys bought a slave bride for young master scotty that day. and the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile. we see scotty and broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime.. at night they catch lightning bugs together. at night in scottys bed, while the young man lay fast asleep, broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of glowing lightning bugs. narrator vo as scottys sort of defacto sweetheart, if no visitors were about, broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table. we see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. narrator.vo and pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family. mrs.harmony and broomhilda sewing together. the harmony family and broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard. after dinner, mrs.harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano. mr.harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook. narrator vo scotty was never happier. scotty and broomhilda walking holding hands at southern magic hour. broomhilda having sex with scotty, baby talking with him, talking him through it, making him feel loved and secure. narrator vo after three months of this bliss, scotty decided to take broomhilda for a romantic weekend in greenville. scotty and broomhilda drive through the main street of greenville, dressed to the nines, in a fancy carriage. broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress, complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol. scotty, very proud of his pretty pony, is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy. 6o narrator vo white masters would take their pretty ponys to greenville for a treat or romantic excursion, for two reasonsone, seeing how bad the other slaves had it, always made the papered ponys appreciate their privilege position, just in case theyd forgot. broomhilda holding her parasol, looking like a black daisy miller, watches the other slaves march by in the mud. they watch her too. int  hotel lobby  night broomhilda and scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel lobby, and rent a room at the front desk. insert hotel registry scotty signs his name. the desk clerks hand checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion. int . greenville  night greenville at night is a little different. at night, rich white masters showing off their ponys like scotty, rule the streets. narrator vo and two, there was a sliver of society that ran through greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to as, nigger love. at night the streets, the bars, bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty ponys. ext  cleopatra club  night an establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into private club called, the cleopatra club. narrator vo but the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity, was the members only, cleopatra club. insert gold plaque with the name, the cleopatra club on it, next to it is a profile of nefertiti. 6 int  the cleopatra club  restaurant  night the interracial joint is jumping as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women. scotty and broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room. we see across the dining room, the powerful white man, calvin candie, sitting with some white men and some black ponys, eyeing broomhilda. scotty i gotta tell you broomhilda  i dont care if i go to. hell for this  i love you. and if loving you means i go to hell ... . well then hello mr.devil. that was actually kind of funny. broomhilda was right, all he needed was a little confidence. she puts her hand on his. narrator vo then... speak of the devil and the devil appears. calvin candie appears at their table. calvin candie hello, my name is calvin candie, i own the cleopatra club. and i would just like to welcome an attractive couplelike yourselves to my favorite place on earth. scotty stands up and shakes hands with calvin. scotty thank you so much, its a great honor. we love it here. pointing at a empty chair. calvin candie may i join you scotty please, by all means. calvin sits down. broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack. scotty, as per usual, is clueless. calvin candie how long have you been a member scotty we just joined this weekend. calvin candie well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage. some may consider the dues excessive, but theyre necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle weve all become accustomed to. scotty well said, and money well spent. he squeezes broomhildas hand. candie sees this. calvin candie it would be.my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table. broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided. but scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like calvin candie. she tries to imply they should stay where they are. he brushes her off with a, dont be silly. we see calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they join the party. calvin candie has his arm around a foxy pony named sheba, whose dress is a little more revealing then the others. they drink and talk, and the white men have a forced good time. but calvin candie cant hide his sinister side from broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed. scottys having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to scottys disobedience. if these fancy.fucking white men werent around making scotty feel so puffy chested, hed never dismiss her that way. we follow broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel. narrator vo after excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room. she got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didnt care, the night was ruined anyway. some romantic weekend. wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her. shell fix his fat ass. wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time. shes gonna scrape every pimple. 3 . back at the

django what dr.schultz can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters django why dr.schultz because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if we want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males. so my character is that of a big money buyer from dusseldorf, here in greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game. and your character is the mandingo expert i hired to help me do it. django they call that oneeyed charly.

anniversary, special treat.  some are.two men with two women. some are one man with two or three or more women. the white mens ages range from early twenties to old men. the girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen. the bill of fare is a combination of french cuisine, and hearty beef driven american dining. the dolled up, decked outponys eat rich french cuisine complete with elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak. the younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana splits, and cookies. whileall the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all

they walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they say dr.schultz how long have you been associated with mr.candie moguy calvin and i were about eleven when we went to boarding school together. one could almost say, i was raised to be calvins lawyer. django one could almost say, you a nigger. coco cant believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to mr.moguy. moguy what did you say dr.schultz oh nothing, hes just being cheeky. anything else about mr.candie i should know before i meet him moguy yes, hes a bit of a francophile. 7ef dr.schultz what civilized people arent moguy thats why all the french ambiance. and he prefers monsieur candie to mister candie. dr.schultz says in french subtitled in english dr.schultz french what ever he prefers. this stops moguy, and he turns to warn schultz. moguy oh he doesnt speak french. dont speak french to him, itll embarrass him. they get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room. moguy slides the doors open... the party enters the billiard room. int  billiard room cleopatra club  night inside is calvin candie, his bodyguard bartholomew still dressed in the ill fitting suit, and the lanky sexy sheba. also, at this moment, two mandingos are having a bloody and savage fight to death in this closed room. an older european looking man, whos rooting for the mandingo that calvins not rooting for, is also in the room. his name is.amerigo vassepi. before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, calvin says calvin candie why do you want to get in the mandingo business thats quite abrupt and aggressive. dr.schultz says, as if hes just been massively insulted dr.schultz you dont intend to allow your 2nd... referring to moguy .to make the proper introductions without turning towards them, candie tells schultz 7s calvin candie quit stalling and answer the question. the room is quiet. dr.schultz the awful truth pause im bored, and it seems like a good bit of fun. candie takes that to heart. hell accept it for now. calvin candie well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight goin on thats a good bit of fun dr.schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight. the bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one. schultz has schooled django on the importance of never breaking character. well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches. which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it. calvin candie. the bigger nigger is mine. i just bought him today. whats his name, moguy moguy big fred. calvin candie the other nigger belongs to this disreputable italian gentlemen to my right. amerigo vassepi. to amerigo whats

calvin candie how bout you, boy you find nigger fightin a good bit of fun django you seen one nigger fight, ya seen em all. calvin candie howd you two like to try the signature drink of the club 79

seasoned slaver, you are a neophyte. im simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you. dr.schultz with all due respect, monsieur candie, i didnt seek you out for your advice. i sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price. i wasunder the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business. calvin candie no we werent

the eyeballin, you the billfold dr.schultz well you dont make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yes. none of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is. candie turns his attention back to django. calvin candie to django so bright boy,.moguy here tells me you looked over my african flesh, and were none too impressed.

side mississippi  day its the next day and a whole procession is making their way to candyland. calvin candie, leonide moguy, dr.schultz, django, and three overseers billy crash, tommy giles, and hoot peters ride horses. bartholomew now dressed in work clothes drives a buckboard filled withsupplies. five mandingos big fred and banjo who we already met, plus joshua, sidney james, and tatum recently purchased at the greenville auction walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal possessions under their arm. they look like powerful warriors. three other shirtless mandingos rodney, chicken charly, chester who were the mandingos from candyland that didnt sell at greenville are walking back to candyland, with their small bundle of personal possessions under their arms. these poor devils know their fate is pretty dismal. either theyll be sold to the lequint dickey mining company, or theyll be put in some mandingo fight they cant win, like with samson, or stonesiphers dogs. j rodney walks along the road, looks up at django riding his horse. all the slaves hate django because they think hes a black slaver. but the three heading back to candyland are even more resentful. flash on django with schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three. rodney gives django a bad eyeball look up on his horse. django on tony sees it. hes playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he cant let that shit stand. he yells down to the powerless man django gotta problem with your eyeball, boy rodney looks away. rodney no sir. django you want a boot heel in it rodney no sir. django then keep ya damn eyeballs off me flash that bad look at me again, ill give ya reason not to like me as this parade makes progress, django keeps his emotions in check, but not without difficulty. dr.schultz comes riding fritz beside him. dr.schultz how do you like this side of the slave trade django not so much. dr.schultz prefer the other side django i didnt say that. dr.schultz ive confirmed broomhildas at candyland. django are you sure its her dr.schultz he didnt call her by name, but shes a young lady, whip marks on her back, and speaks german. now while its not wise to assume, in this instance, i think its pretty safe. django did you offer to buy her dr.schultz i opened the door to my possible interest. but naturally, sight unseen, i can only be so interested. suddenly ... calvin candie comes riding up behind them... calvin candle am i intruding dr.schultz of course not. calvin candie appraising the two men i swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish. dr.schultz youd be surprised what a good conversationalist django is. calvin candie oh by now, i dont think that would surprise meat all. candie gives django a creepy smile. around now the audience may start noticing dog barking in the distance. dr.schultz when do we reach your property 13 calvin candle you been on it. i own the whole sixty miles fore we get to candyland. candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs. calvin candie excuse me a moment, gentlemen. yelling behind him at billy billy crash, git up here billy crash, a hillbilly overseer whos missing his two front teeth, rides up. billy crash yeah, boss calvin candie find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack billy crash right away, boss. billy crash tears up ahead on his horse. calvin candie you know, confidentially, just tween us girls, worse things about this business, aint the slaves. its all the white trash ya gotta deal with. like these peckawoods we got riding with us. these dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches aint good fer nuttin, except kickin a niggers ass cant kick back. yeah, they holdin the pretty part of the whip, but its just a thin membrane separate em. and dont think they dont know it either. its about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know. but ya need em. who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself. but these mountain boys i use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst. nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies. now like that nigger gal we was talkin bout. im sure it.was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that german lady taught hildi how to speak german. django hears her name himself. his head does involuntary jerk, but his , emotions betray nothing. pte calvin candie cont now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak english. i cant understand a damn word most of em say. you could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork. i tell ya, if it wasnt for catchin a nigger on the run, theyd be as useless as tits on a boar hog. billy crash comes riding back. calvin candie what the hells goin on billy crash they got em a runaway. calvin candie who cut to ext  tracker shack  day a bunkhouse for the four hillbilly trackers they track down runaway slaves that live here about forty miles from the candyland plantation. a little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the bunkhouse. the trackers are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty long haired lot. their leader is mr.,stonesipher, the other three are stew, lex, and jake. the four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons, or just from the same hollow. lex holds two snarling german shepherds on a leash. stew one snarling german shepherd on a leash. and mr.stonesipher holds one snarling german shepherd on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of marsha. a runaway slave named, dartagnan, lies belly down in the dirt, surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who bark, growl, and snap at him. one look at dartagnan tells you hes a mandingo whos been in one fight too many. one of his eyes have been poked out. big bites have been bit out of both his face and neck by past fights, human bites, notthe dogs, as well as three fingers have been bit off. not to mention hes covered in cuts, like hes been drug through a briar patch. o v5 the fourth tracker, jake, doesnt engage in the melodrama. he hangs in the background, cutting firewood with a big axe. calvin candie, dr.schultz, django, and the whole candie caravan look down on the runaway slave. including the five new mandingos, and the three old mandingos who know dartagnan. calvin candie well ill be, dartagnan. now boy, why do a fool thing like run off dartagnan i cant fight no more, monsieur candie. calvin candie oh yes you can. you might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.  mr.stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up, i cant hear myself think mr.stonesipher, yells to marsha mr.stonesipher hush now marsha marsha, hush up marsha, marsha, hush up to the other trackers take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, hes just makin em hungry. the other two yank the dogs away from the fallen black man. calvin candie how long was he loose mr. stonesipher spits tobacco juice. mr.stonesipher a.night. day. half the other night. calvin candie how far he git off property mr.stonesipher bout twenty miles off prop. pretty fer, considering that limp he got. calvin candie moguy, who was dartagnan suppose to fight friday. moguy pointing behind him one of this new lot. calvin candie well the way he looks now a blind indian wouldnt bet a bead on em. to dartagnan boy, you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear. dartagnan starts begging. calvin candie now now, no beggin, no playin on my soft heart. you in trouble now, son. now you need to understand im runnin a business. now i done paid five hundred dollars for you. and when i pay five hundred dollars, i expect to get five fights outta a nigga fore he roll over and play dead. youve fought three fights. dartagnan i won every one. calvin candie well, yes you did. but that last one, you muddied the line between winning and losing. calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway on the ground. calvin candie but the fact remains, i pay five hundred dollars, i want five fights. so what about my five hundred dollars you gonna reimburse me the whites except for schultz laugh. this whole spectacle is making dr.schultz sick to his stomach. not django ... . hes seen this little drama play out many times before. the three returning mandingos, rodney, chicken charly, and chester, watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away. the five new mandingos watch calvin candies treatment of dartagnan to know what to expect from their new home. bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor bastard. calvin prods further. calvin candie you even know what reimburse means e 17 the whites laugh. then suddenly ... .the german speaks dr.schultz ill reimburse you. all eyes turn to dr.schultz. including djangos, whose eyes narrow at the doctor. calvin candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the direction of the good german. calvin candie you will removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket. dr.schultz yes. calvin candie youll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed olejoe, aint fit to push a broom djangos voice cuts through the mississippi heat. django no he wont. all eyes turn to django. django hes just tiredof you toyin with him is all. and for that matter, so am i. but we aint payin a penny for that pickaninny, we aint got no use for em. aint that right, doc dr.schultz realizes hes just done the one thing hes always preached to django you can never do..break character. the doctor puts his billfold back in his suit coat pocket. dr.schultz to candie you heard em. the hillbilly trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the green jacket, slack jawed.  even the one chopping wood in the bg stops his chopping. calvin candie youll hafta excuse mr.stonesiphers slack jawed gaze. he aint never seen a nigger like you ever in his life..aint that right, mr. stonesipher mr.. stonesipher., spits. mr.stonesipher thats right. calvin steps up to django on his horse. looking up at the black man, calvin challenges django to a staring contest. calvin candie well now since you wont pay a penny for this pickaninny, you wont mind me handlin this nigger however i see fit django hes your nigger. calvin candie mr.ston.esipher... .let marsha and her bitches send dartagnan to nigger heaven. mr.stonesipher marsha...git em the other trackers let loose of the leashes holding the german shepherds back. the dogs charge towards dartagnan on his knees... the mandingos all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose. the dogs attack dartagnan ... as we hear the attack ... candie.staring contest with django... django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesnt blink as the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ... the other mandingos are scared sick at what they see. the hillbilly trackers root the dogs on. dr.schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he appears not to enjoy it. calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward dr.schultz, then back . to django. p9 calvin candie your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fightin as dartagnans screams and marshas growls continue off screen. django naw, he just aint use to seein a man ripped apart by dogs, is all. calvin candie but you are use to it django well, him bein german an all, im a little more use to americans then he is. now monsieur candie, whenever youre ready, we rode five hours so you could show off your stock. lets git to it. cause as of now, if hes a example, i aint impressed. calvin...blink... saying nothing, monsieur candie turns his back to django, climbs up on his horse, then looks at the black man. calvin candie follow me. the whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear dartagnan apart. ext  the grounds of candyland  day the caravan starts to approach candyland. calvin candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of mississippi. as the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of slaves picking it. the audience might of been expecting candyland to be a hell on earth, auschwitz, andersonville, yuma prison, a mexican prison in a sergio corbucci spaghetti western ... instead ... . candyland is very beautiful. the fields of cotton, the way the trees hang green vines over everything. its full of nature and natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in. one of the cottonpickers in the field, dobie, looks up, and sees django in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of tony. he taps the shoulder of another cotton picker orwell, and points out django. 90 all of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse. django looks back matching their stare. ext  slave village  day the caravan rolls through the shackcabin village the slaves live in. as the parade rolls through all the slaves snap to attention, and bow very formally as monsieur candie rides past. a king among his subjects, a patron with his peons, a father amongst his children, a shepherd among his sheep. kids playing in the dirt get up and run to calvin on his horse. candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and begins tossing them about. the kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy. this is calvin candie in his element, at his happiest. then ... .django rides by. the caravan moves from the slave village to the white village the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds. other then the switch of white faces for black, its pretty much the same village. and they too see django ... . wow the caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the plantation, or the big house as everyone calls it. to the left of the big house is big wooden arena built for his friday night nigger fights. all the house slaves the domestic slaves that work for the candie family in the big house, and white workers overseers and stray farm hands come out to greet the caravan. they all greet monsieur calvin candie, who naturally leads the procession, as if hes alexander the great returning from the wars. as the caravan comes to a stop in front of the big house, it creates a huge dust cloud behind it. calvins widowed sister lara lee candiefitzwilly, an attractive . fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of the big house to greet her brother. directly above lara lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out. steps... stephen eyeing calvin and the approaching caravan. whos stephen stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate, and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out of dickens  if dickens wrote about house niggers in the antebellum south.  stephen has been calvins slave since he was a little boy. and in almost every way is the 2nd most powerful person at candyland. like the characters basil rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil, scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power for their own self interest. well that describes stephen to a tee. the basil rathbone of house niggers. the old man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach. then... out of the dust cloud ...emerge django and schultz... . on tony and fritz. all the candylanders see django, dressed like he is, up on the horse, and for a moment dont know what to think. lara lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued. as stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket, its hate at first sight. stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a, limp. all the caravan riders are still up on their horses. calvin sees stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do calvin candie hello stephen my boy stephen yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass  whos this nigger up on that nag calvin candie oh stephen, why so ornery, you miss me stephen yeah, i miss you like i miss.a rock in my shoe. like i said, whos this nigger, up on that nag djangos voice

calvin candie that nigger there. let me at least introduce the two of. you. django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, stephen. stephen, this is django. you two should hate each other. stephen usesthe special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at candyland. stephen calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain calvin candie django and his friend

problem, right now, is making a good impression. and i want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. the old man looks up at his master, and says stephen yes sir, monsieur candie. stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering tohimself. lara lee and her ever present shadow, a fat mammy named cora, comes up to her brother on his horse. calvin candie dr.schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may i present to you, lara lee candiefitzwilly. lara lee does a southern lady bow. dr.schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. dr.schultz i am dr.king schultz, this is my 2nd django, django tips his hat and these are our horses, fritz and tony. both fritz and tony do the head bow. dr.schultz and it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose. lara lee well arent you the charming gentlemen. youre not from around here, are you dr.schultz actually im from a far off land, dusseldorf, to be exact. calvin candie these two are in the market for a fightin nigger. so i thought id invite em down, show em my stock. lara lee well all have dinner tonight, right calvin candie half the reason i invited them. i thought youd find.them as intriguing as i do little sister. lara lee looks up at django, and smiles. all of a sudden three white riders ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones. theolder one is the capt of the overseers, ace woody, and his two assistants brown and jingle bells cody. while ace is dressed for work on a farm, both brown and jingle bells cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits. as calvin candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to dr.schultz and django, and says calvin candie you know since i started fightin niggers about eleven years ago, its been a new lease onlife. and the man ridin up here now is the man responsible for all my success. ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust. through the dust ace, brown, and jingle bells cody eyeball django and schultz. calvin candie howdy ace. to schultz and django this here is my overseer .capt, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, ace woody. 915 pointing at the two shadows that flank ace woody. calvin candie and thats brown and thats jingle bells cody. to ace ace, this here is dr.ring schultz, and django freeman, theyre big customers with big pockets wanna buy a

horse. everybody, including django and dr.schultz, watch the show. acewoody walks up and down the line looking at the new men. candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says calvin candie what do

ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and shoots sidney james point blank in the belly. everybody reacts. especially the four other mandingos standing next to him. sidney james rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut. till cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery. moguy, shakes his head, typical, he thinks. django and schultz, on their horses

eyes on the three remaining mandingos 1 00 ace woody to mandingos those of you with exceptional ability will find it aint so bad here. those of you who dont possess exceptional ability, will wish you

terrified mandingos to the arena. candie leans over to schultz and says calvin candle we only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy. but those two tend to be lucky. ace woody hops back up on his horse. calvin candie you know mr.woody, im beginning to think that you dont trust my judgement ace woody just smiles at his boss, and says ace woody oh you know i always trust your judgement, boss candie...eventually. he rides off. stephen limps back to the action. calvin candie ahhh, stephen my boy, rooms ready stephen all ready for your guest and his nigger. candieshakes his head in mock frustration. calvin candie stephen, youre incorrigible. to schultz and django gentlemen, let stephen show you to your rooms. o calvin candle cont there you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours. then well have some lemonade, and ill show off some of my finer specimens. dr.schultz splendid. both dr.schultz and django climb down from their horses. candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named timmy. calvin candie timmy boy, go take their horses for em. fix em up at the stable, give em a load of oats. django hands the boy the reigns. django thats fritz, this is tony. you take good care of em now. timmy yes, sir. django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy. django once hes in the stable, give em that. he reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one. django give that one to fritz. timmy leads the horses away. the two visitors start to follow stephen to their rooms, when dr.schultz pretends to remember something dr.schultz oh, monsieur candie, about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about calvin candie nigger girl dr.schultz i believe you said she spoke german calvin candie oh yes, hildi, what about her ,oz. dr.schultz do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room calvin candie i dont see why not. to stephen stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch hildi. i want her cleaned up and smellin nice, and sent over to dr.schultzs room. stephen has to be the bearer of bad news. stephen actually... . monsieur candie... . theres somethin we aint tole you yet. calvin candie what stephen hildis in the hot box. this gets djangos, schultzs, and candies attention. calvin candie whats she doin there stephen what cha think she doin in the hot box, she bein punished. calvin candie what she do stephen she ran away again. calvin candie jesus christ, how many people ran away when i was gone stephen two. calvin candie when did she go stephen last night. they brought her back this morning. calvin candle how bad did stonesiphers dogs tear her up djangos hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. if they sicked those dogs on his angel, hes going to just kill all these motherfuckers right now. stephen lucky for her they were busy lookin for dartagnans ass. brown and cody went out lookin for her and found her. she a little beat up, but she did that to herself. runnin through them damn bushes. djangos hand moves away from his gun. calvin candie how long she been in the box stephen whatcha think, all goddamn day little fool got ten more days to go. calvin candle take her out. stephen incredulous take her out why calvin candle because i said so, thats why. hildi is my nigger. dr.schultz is my guest. southern hospitality dictates i make her available to him. stephen but monsieur candie, she just ran away calvin candle jesus christ stephen, whats the point of havin a nigger speaks german ifyou cant wheel em out when you have a german guest i realize its inconvenient. still, take her out. to cora and lara lee lara lee would you and cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for dr.schultz the overseers,tommy giles and hoot peters go to the hot.box. while billy crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water. django watches them walk to the hot box. dr.schultzs eyes shift to django, to watch him watch this. stephen notices djangos interest in both the hot box and whoevers sizzling in it. the hot box itself is a large iron solitary confinement cell door from yuma prison built into the ground. they put a key in the lock, and the two men lift the heavy iron door open. revealing a naked broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box dug into the ground. broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine. when ... billy crash tosses the bucket of water on her. django watches this. djangos pov.from his wide shot perspective we see them yank the naked broomhilda incoherent out of the hole. revenge music plays as we move into a sergio leone cu of djangos face. stephen breaks the mood. stephen to django you comin, or you wanna sleep in that little box django turns his back on the naked broomhilda and follows stephen and dr.schultz up the front steps of the big house. int  the big house  day stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of the big house. then down the hallway with the guest rooms. dr.schultz is shown his guest room by stephen. schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him. stephen takes django to the room next door, opens the door, and leads him in. int  djangos guest room  day a guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it. a little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it. 105 stephen this ones yours, boy. that beds damn nice too. django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out. broomhildas gone. as he looks through the glass, snotty stephen rattles on in the background. stephen feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin all this shit once you gone. ill have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready. django sits down on the bed. stephen turns to leave. django not so fast. stephen i got more important things to do then jaw with you. django nigger, when i say stop you plant roots. both the words and the tone stop stephen dead. he turns around. django this tiny bell on this little table... .is this for you i ring this, you do fer me stephen me or somebody. django reaches over and picks up the bell. a soft dingaling stephen unamused what cha want django i want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up. stephen does what hes told, but with attitude. o django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone. once stephens done, django stands up from the bed. django gimmie. stephen hands him the basin full of water. django takes it from him. then throws the water in stephens face. the dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man. django whatsamatter stephen, you dont like that django takes his hand and slaps the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor django thats my kinda bell ringin. git up. the old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor  as soon as he does  django slaps him to the floor again. then django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the floor below his knees. django ive known me house niggers like you my whole life. play your dog tricks with your massa. ya lip off to him every now an then, as long as ya keep it funny. he rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think its so cute. meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin and jumpin to stay on your good side. well this time snowball, you gonna listen to me. you got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, im gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of me beatin the black off your ass. i will make you drop your drawers, ill take off my belt, and i will wup your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation. and after i do that, lets see you play the rooster round here. x07 stephen calvin wouldnt. let you do it. django oh thats right, he gives you first name privileges... . aint that cute. sass me me again nigger, see what happen. stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue. django thats what i thought. now git outtahere. with as much dignity as he can muster, stephen stands up. before he leaves, django tells him, django when i ring this bell, you better come a runnin. you  not nobody else. while im on this property, you my nigger snowball. stephen leaves. django lies down on the bed. he covers his eyes with his arm. a door joins django and schultzs room. the adjoining door opens, and schultz stands there. dr.schultz was that wise django doesnt remove his arm from.his eyes. django he aint tellin nobody bout that. thats all that needs to be said. int  hallway big house  day lara lee, cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up shes dressed in a domestic maid uniform broomhilda stand outside dr.schultzs door, after calvins sister raps on it. dr.schultz opens the door. dr.schultz hello ladies. dog lara lee dr.schultz, may i introduce to you, hildi. hildi, this is dr.schultz, he speaks german. dr.schultz to broomhilda ive been informed you do as well. broomhilda german it would be my, pleasure to speak with you in german. schultz acts for the benefit of miss laras astonishment. dr.schultz astonishing. in german please come inside fraulein. she does, and justas lara lee is to say something, schultz says, thank you very much, and closes the door in her face. miss lara looks to her mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed. int  schultzs guest room big house  late afternoon with the door closed, schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl. he gives her a pleasant smile. dr.schultz they call you hildi, but your real name is broomhilda, isnt it broomhilda yes. how do you know that dr.schultz stands to reason who ever taught you german would also give you a german name. can i pour you a glass of water, broomhilda hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not to mention with a german accent, does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl. 107 we cut to django on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue to present himself. back to broomhilda and dr.schultz as dr.schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins talking to her in german subtitled in english dr.schultz german im aware you havent spoken german in a long while. so ill talk slowly. im only speaking german to you now, broomhilda, in case candies people are listening to us. myself and a mutual friend of ours, have gone through a lot of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to find you fraulein  to rescue you. he hands her a tall clear glass of water. she looks at him weird, rescue me dr.schultz german please drink. she absentmindedly obeys. dr.schultz .german. now its myself and our mutual friends intention to take you away from here forever. broomhilda german i dont got any friends. dr.schultz german yes you do. broomhilda german who dr.schultz german i cant tell you. our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic, and he wants to surprise you. 0 broomhilda german where is he he points at the adjoining door. dr.schultz german standing right behind that door. her head moves in the direction of the door. he looks to the young woman dr.schultz german promise me you wont scream she nods her head, yes. dr.schultz german say, i promise. broomhilda german i promise. dr.schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it. the door knob turns. the door slowly opens revealing... her husband django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up. he smiles at her, and says django hey little trouble maker. obviously a pet name between them. broomhilda goes into a bit of shock... .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and the water spills on the floor ... .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint. 11 the two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other dr.schultz you silver tongued devil you. montage we dissolve to later, as we see dr.schultz and django explain what theyre doing there, who theyre pretending to be, and what their plan is to broomhilda. we hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack. its not a happy tune.. .per se. but its pretty, and vaguely optimistic ... we dissolve to the slave pen the doomed men who didnt sell at greenville, brooding rodney and chester and chicken charly, spend their last night at candyland sleeping under the stars in the slave pen. the same whistling tune continues over this scene. rodney sees, the whole slave selling and buying group, django, dr.schultz, candie, bartholomew, moguy, ace woody, brown and cody, and the overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to the arena. laughin and joshin all the way. the hatred rodney feels for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker. a study in powerless fury. dissolve to broomhilda setting the dinner table in the dining room of the big house with its knives, spoons and forks. shes all by herself as she goes through this duty. the whistling tune weve been listening to has been coming from broomhilda whistling as she sets the table. suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears stephen. stephen what you. whistlin, girl broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in stephens direction. stephen what was you whistlin broomhilda oh nuttin. stephen you werent whistlin nothin, you were whistlin somethin. whatcha whistlin broomhilda i dunno. somethin i heard. i dont know no.name. z stephen its kinder pretty. she doesnt say anything in return. stephen that was a compliment. broomhilda thank you. stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to broomhilda. stephen im just sayin, two days ago you wus in such misery here, you hadda run off. so you run off, we catch your ass an drag you back. then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in the hot box for bout ten hours. now here you are two days later, whistlin while you work. im just sayin, i.wouldn think youd have a hellva lot to whistle bout. .im jus sayin. he watches the effect his words have on broomhildas face. broomhilda im done here, may i be excused stephen yes you may. she moves off to another part of the house. he watches her shuffle off. int  dining room big house  night later that evening, django and a lot of other white people calvin candie, lara lee, moguy, and dr.schultz sat around the dinner table. they are being served by the black people weve come to know at candyland stephen, cora, and because dr.schultz likes her broomhilda. along with an army of domestic slaves acting as wait service. knowing djangos a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the domestic slaves despise django. even broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade. we pick up the conversation in midnegotiation. 5. dr.schultz look monsieur candle, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it. but the best three, by far, were sampson, goldie, and eskimo joe.  by the way, whys he called eskimo joe calvin candie oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started. his name was joe...maybe one day he said he was cold.. .who knows dr.schultz irregardless, we all know samsons your best, and youll never sell him and i can see why, hes a champion. calvin candie all three are champions. django contradicts, as he chews his steak django samsons the champion. the other two are pretty good. all the domestic slaves around the table stiffen at witnessing django contradict calvin candie. including broomhilda, whos wielding the gravy boat. after django says that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on lara lees mashed potatoes. lara lee hildi broomhilda snaps back. instead of getting angry, candle seems to reflect on that analysis, then issues his own appraisal calvin candie can eskimo joe whip sampson, no. can he take goldie, probably not  goldies the best dirty fightin nigger i ever saw. but as long as you dont put em up against those two., eskimo joe will whip any niggers ass. django maybe. the domestics freeze for a jerky second when django says that.  f dr.schultz you must understand, monsieur candie, while admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight game, i do have a bit of a background in the european traveling circus. hence, i have big ideas when it comes to presentation. i need something more then just a big nigger. he needs to have panache. a sense of showmanship. i want to be able to . bill. him as. the black hercules. i said., and i quote i would pay top dollar for the, right nigger. now im not saying eskimo joe is the wrong nigger  per se ... but is he right as rain ...  everyone waits for calvins response. he milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep, then says calvin candie dr.schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, monsieur calvin j. candie. but one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game. beat a nigger that can win fights. that should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern. after you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design. but since i enjoy oldest man at the table status  beating moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first. broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans. dr.schultz says something pleasant to her in german.. she smiles, and says something pleasant back. calvin candie i see you two gettin on dr.schultz breaks into a wide grin dr.schultz .famously. dramatic pause monsieur candie, you cant imagine what its like not to hear you native tongue for four years. calvin candie hell, i cant imagine two weeks in boston. 5 everybody at the table chuckles. dr.schultz i cant express the joy i felt conversing in my mother tongue. and broomhilda is a charming conversation companion. as broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for moguy, lara lee notices how django and broomhilda look and try not to look at each other. stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for monsieur candie. lara lee i dont know doctor, you can lay on all the german sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for django. lara lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, django, broomhilda, and schultz, involuntarily jerk. and ... .stephen sees it. schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook. except for stephen, no one else was the wiser. broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen. stephen watches her go, then looks at django, then hands candie his mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the tables benefit. calvin candie stephen, youre amazing. i havent finished a drink in this house in twenty years. stephen when a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a cold drink. chuckle... . chuckle... calvin candie did you overhear that joke i said about me spending two weeks in boston stephen mock indignant you dont have any idea the work i do to see food gets on the table. 16 calvin candie what does that hafta do with the price of tea in china stephen you think when im in that kitchen, i got nothin better to do then listen in here to you tellin unfunny jokes chuckle... . chuckle... calvin candie mock indignation what they laughed stephen of course they laughed, their parents raised them right. when theyre a guest in somebodys house, and the master of of the house thinks hes funny, you suppose to laugh. theyd be rude not to. chuckle... .chuckle... they play their little comedy routine for all its worth. calvin candie no it was really funny, to table wasnt it stephen now what do you expect these people to say what you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest. to table everybody dont laugh at him, youre being polite, i understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him. chucklechuckle... as the white folks chuckle, stephen moves back into the kitchen. tnt  kitchen big house  night once stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks eyes on broomhilda. he moves over to her. stephen you know that nigger  she spins around. 11 7 broomhilda who stephen dont stall me bitch, you know who broomhilda at the table i dont know him. stephen. you dont know him broomhilda no. stephen you wouldnt lie to me now, would you she shakes her head, no. stephen looks at her skeptical. stephen okay, if you say so. back to dinner table pick it up again in midnegotiation. django eskimo joes a quality nigger, no doubt about it. but if it was my money, i wouldnt pay twelve thousand dollars for him. dr.schultz what would your price be django well, if i ,was inclined to be generous,. and i dont know why i would be inclined to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe. candies lawyer chimes in. moguy but the real question is, not how much he cost, but how much he can earn dr.schultz django django in a years time, seven or eight fights  outside of mississippi  where his candyland pedigree werent well known  virginia... cont 11y django cont georgia  all goes well ...twenty to twenty one thousand dollars. calvin candie precisely bright boy, good on ya. any way you cut that cake, that spells profit. not to, mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger. however let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about. it wasnt me who came to you to sell a nigger, it was you who approached me to buy one. now that nine thousand dollar figure bright boy was banding about, aint too far off from right. and if i wanted to sell eskimo joe for that, i could sell em any day of the week. but like you said in greenville doctor, i dont wanna sell em. it was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it. dr.schultz considerscalvin candies words, then suddenly says dr.schultz you know monsieur candie... . you do possess the power of persuasion. candie smiles at that remark. then suddenly schultz slaps the table hard with his hand, and says dr.schultz why not monsieur candie, you have a deal, eskimo joe, twelve thousand dollars the white people at the table get very happy. dr.schultz continues dr.schultz however, that is a tremendous amount of money. and the way you have your mr.moguy, i have a lawyer, a persnickety man named tuttle. and i would need my man to draw up a legal contract before i would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh. not to mention having eskimo joe examined by a physician of my choosing. so say i return in about five days time with my mr.tuttle. and then my mr.tuttle and your mr.moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves. 117 calvin candie splendid. calling to the kitchen stephen, time for dessert stephen, cora, broomhilda, and the other domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes. broomhilda goes to calvin. broomhilda can i take away your dishes, monsieur candle calvin candie yes you may, hildi. she begins gathering the dirty dishes. candie looks up at her as she works. calvin candie so hildi, how you like servin at the big table in the big house broomhilda i like it a lot monsieur candle. calvin candie its a lot better then sizzling in that hot box, or draggin your ass through a bramble bush, aint it broomhilda yes em. with candie interrogating broomhilda, django tenses up. stephen clocks this. stephen decides to test djangos reaction. stephen you know monsieur candle, the doctor might be interested in seein hildis peeled back. seein as he dont see many niggers where he from. calvin candie to schultz when you was alone with hildi here, didja just speak german, or did ya git her clothes off 20 dr.schultz we just spoke. calvin candie so you havent seen her back dr.schultz no i havent. calvin candie then stephens right, you would probably find this interesting. hildi, take off your dress, and show us your back. django hears this. broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to django. stephen clocks it. lara lee calvin, i just got her all dressed up and looking nice. calvin candie but lara lee, dr.schultz is from dusseldorf, they dont got niggers there. and hes a man of medicine. im sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain. i mean hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back. lara lee get one, shed lose her mind. these niggers are tough, no doubt about it. lara lee calvin, we are eating  dessert, no less. aint no one wanna see her whipped up back. django continues to watching this play out. stephen watches him. candie folds. calvin candie okay okay lara. maybe after dinner. during the brandies. broomhilda  dismissed  takes calvins dishes and heads back into the kitchen. stephen takes one more look at django, and follows broomhilda behind the kitchen door. 121 int  kitchen big house  night in the kitchen with the other domestics, stephen says to broomhilda stephen i thought you said you didnt know him broomhilda turns around. broomhilda huh stephen approaches her, the other domestics get quiet and watch. stephen i said, you said, you didnt know him broomhilda i dont. stephen yes you do. broomhilda mister stephen, i dont. stephen why you lyin to me as tears begin to well in her eyes. broombilda i aint. stephen why you cryin broomhilda because youre scarin me. stephen why am i scarin you broomhilda because youre scary. things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside. we hear dr.schultz in the next room say dr.schultz os .to speak german,with hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching. stephen hears this, hes starting to get the idea. 1zl his eyes to to broomhilda. stephen you, stay in the kitchen. stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches dr.schultz prepare to proposition candie for broomhilda. stephen knows these two jokers django and schultz are up to something, and now hes just figured it out. int  dinner table big house  night dr.schultz you indicated earlier you would be willing to part with hildi calvin candie yes siree bob i did. dr.schultz well in that case allow me to propose another proposition in full ole jimmie performance, stephen barges in the room, interrupting dr.schultz. stephen  monsieur candie calvin candie stephen, you just interrupted dr.schultz. stephen to dr.schultz oh, i do apologize, doctor. my hearin aint worth a damn these days. to candie monsieur candie, i need a word with you in the kitchen. calvin candie what, you mean get outta my chair stephen if you could manage it. its about dessert. calvin candie what about dessert stephen i would rather tell you in private. calvin candie were having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there 123 stephen bends down and whispers in his ear stephen meet me in the library. well thats a horse of a different color. that means whatever stephen has to say, hasnt anything to do with rhubarb pie. meet me in the library is their secret signal. calvin candie fine friend stephen, ill be along momentarily. stephen exits. candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table. calvin candie well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required. if youll excuse me a moment. candie exits. tnt  library big house  night a masculine sanctuary for calvin candie. walls of perfectly bound books. stuffed animal heads deer, boar that hes shot, sit mounted on the walls. theres comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe. when we cut to this room, we cut to stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter. calvin enters the room, sees stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his brandy, and doesnt bat an eye. it appears, in this room, calvins and stephens life long friendship exits on a different plane. outside of outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of candyland can talk turkey. calvin candie whats the matter stephen those motherfuckers aint here to buy no mandingos. they want that girl.  calvin candie what the hell you talkin about stephen they playin your ass for a fool, thats what im talkin bout. they aint here for no muscle bound jimmie, they here for that girl. calvin candie what girl, hildi stephen yeah, hildi. the niggers know each other. calvin candie he just bought eskimo joe. stephen did he give you any money calvin candie well not yet, but  stephen  then he didnt r ..y diddly, not yet no how. but he was just about to buy, who he came here to buy, when i interrupted him. thank you stephen  youre welcome calvin. calvin candie where you gettin all this why would they go through all that trouble, to. buy a nigger with a chewed up back, aint worth five hundred dollars stephen well theyre doin it cause djangos in love with hildi. shes probably his wife. now why that german gives a fuck about who that uppity sonofabitch is in love with, im sure i dont know. calvin candie if shes who they want, why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos stephen because you wouldnt pay no never mind to four hundred dollar. but twelve thousand got you real friendly. calvin thinks ... .as per usual, stephens right. calvin candie those

i wouldnt enjoy seein something like that ... . but why dont you sit down and lets talk about this. calvin candle i let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table, and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool stephen calmthefuckdown, sit down, and lets discuss this. a frustrated calvin finally collapses in the chair. stephen now look, you knew, and i knew, there was something up with these two. we just didnt know what. but now we do. they dont want you to know how bad they want that girl. but these ole boys have rode a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl. they must want her mighty bad. way i see it, aint nothin changed. they wanna buy a nigger, you wanna sell a nigger.the only thing done changed is the advantage. beat now we got it. .so lets go back in there and busts these motherfuckers chops. int  dining room big house  night the dinner table guests listen to lara leecandiefitzwilly hold court melodramatically ... . till ... . calvin candie enters the room from the kitchen door. lara lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon seeing him lara lee there you are i was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together. schultz and django feel the change in their hosts demeanor, as he stares down the table at them. calvin candle thatd be a hellva note, wouldnt it lara lee cont 1z j calvin candie cont lara lee, i just looked out the big winda. ace woodys out there dealin with some shady slaver sellin a passel of ponys. would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball. that of boy knows everything to know bout mandingos, but he dont know diddly bout black puddin. lara lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out, bartholomew, with his sawed off shotgun, comes.in behind schultz and django. calvin candie can i ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder schultz and django do, and see bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them. calvin candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand hes holding a big ugly hammer. calvin candie now lay your palms flat on the table top. they put their palms on the table. calvin candie now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top, bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off. theres been a lotta lies said around this table tonightbut that.. .you can believe. beat mr.moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin on those boyships mr.moguy does. holding the hammer in his hand, candie continues to hold court. calvin candie now where were we oh yes, i do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy broomhilda. right dr.schultz right. calvin candie yelling to stephen stephen bring out hildi ix stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding roughly in his grip, broomhilda. he holds a small derringer pistol against the side of her head. django and schultz react. calvin candie now it should be quite clear by now i know youre not here to buy no mandingos. reason yall came to candyland, is yall want broomhilda. but yall dont want me to know how much you want er. so instead, you waste my time with all this eskimo joe horseshit. to stephen stephen, put her in that chair. stephen sits the young lady down in moguys old chair. with their palms against the table, unarmed, django and schultz silently watch candies next move. candie, still holding the hammer, continues. calvin candie now the way i see it, aint nothin changed.. you still wanna buy a nigger, i still wanna sell one. so, with that in mind, in greenville, dr.schultz, you yourself said, for the right nigger youd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount. to which, me myself said, what is your definition of ridiculous to which you said, twelve thousand dollars. now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would appear that broomhilda is, the right nigger. and if yall wanna leave candyland with broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars. dr.schultz i take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating. candie continuing to hold the hammer continues. calvin candie under the laws of chickasaw county, broomhilda is my property. and i can do anything with my property i so desire. he brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making everybody jump. in calvin candie and if you think my price for this nigger is too steep, what im gonna desire to do is, take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it. right in front of both yall. he smashes the arm rest of the chair broomhildas sitting in. calvin candie put up or shut up, schultz. you wanna save this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price. dr.schultz may i lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold calvin candie yes you may. dr.schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket, and says, dr.schultz easy come, easy go. he slides the billfold down the table to candie. the plantation owner takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at the seated schultz, and says calvin candie pleasure doin business with you. time cut int  dining room big house  night insert calvin signing over broomhildas bill of sale. .moguy signs as a witness. broomhilda stands next to django, and watches her master sign her freedom papers. dr.schultz sits off by himself. hes very disturbed. all the white people with calvin candie are happy and celebrate candies successes with glasses of brandy. lara lee, ace woody, and brown and cody have joined the celebration. for an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend. he just sold a pony, with a tore up back, and a runaway r burned in her cheek  aint worth five hundred dollars for twelve thousand. stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else. the other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people. candie walks over to the seated schultz, he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him. calvin candie to schultz rhubarb pie schultz looks at the pie and the man. dr.schultz no. calvin candie are you brooding bout me getting the best of ya dr.schultz actually, i was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, dartagnan. and i was wondering what dumas would make of all this. calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. broomhildas bill of sale, and her freedom papers. as he says the following he examines he papers. calvin candie dumas... dr.schultz alexander dumas. he wrote the three musketeers. i figured you must be an admirer. you named your slave after that novels lead character. if alexander dumas had been there today, i wonder what he would of made of it calvin candie you doubt hed approve dr.schultz yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best. calvin candie soft hearted frenchy dr.schultz alexander dumas is black. 1 30 schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two companions, django and broomhilda, and says dr.schultz we got it, lets go. to candie normally monsieur candie, i would say, auf wiedersehen. but since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till i see you again, and since i never wish to see you again, to you sir, i say, goodbye. schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. when calvin says to the germans back calvin candie one more moment, doc dr.schultz what calvin candie its a custom here in the south, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. it implies good faith. dr.schultz im not from the south. he turns to leave. calvin candie youre in my house, doctor, im afraid i must insist. this turns schultz around. dr.schultz insist what... that i shake your hand before i leave then im afraid i must insist in the opposite direction. calvin walks closer to the german doctor. calvin candie you know what i think you are dr.schultz what you think i am no i dont. 1310, calvin candle i think you are a bad loser. dr.schultz and i think youre an abysmal winner. calvin candle never the less, here in chickasaw county a deal aint done till the two parties have shook hands. even after all this paper signin, dont mean shit you dont shake my hand. dr.schultz if i dont shake your hand, youre gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars... i dont think so. schultz looks to django and broomhilda. dr.schultz lets go. calvin candie bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this german shakes my hand. cut er down. schultz looks to django... . then to candle.. .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks candle dr.schultz. you really want me to shake your hand django gets it. calvin candie i insist. dr schultz smiles. dr.schultz well, if you insist. django goes to stop him... 1 714 the german crosses toward candie, offering him his hand... candie offers his hand to schultz... the small derringer pops into schultzs outstretched hand... pop he shoots calvin candie in the heart. candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. everybody is stunned. schultz looks to django. django looks back. dr.schultz to django im sorry. i couldnt resist. dr.schultz is blown apart by bartholomews sawed off shotgun. the room comes to its senses and attacks django and broomhilda. fade to black we fade up from black to see the soles of djangos bare feet. a rope is tied around the ankles, and its obvious hes been strung up, upside down. the camera moves down his naked body, down his legs we see his wrists arebound with ropes to his thigh, down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor. int  barn  afternoon eight year old stable boy, timmy, wipes the unconscious djangos face with a wet rag. they are all alone in the barn. django begins to come to ... timmy shhhs him act like you still sleepin. django wheres broomhilda timmy who django hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. they had her in the hot box. timmy i dont know bout no girl. django how bout that german white man i came here with timmy oh hes dead. his bodys over there. django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend king schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. the sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills django with pain and anger. just then head overseer ace woody walks in the barn. upon seeing ace, timmy hightails it out of there, ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy. ace woody git on outta here, boy 133 django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at ace woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like wyatt earp. ace woody so yall bounty hunters,.huh django thinks, how does he know ace woody i knew there was something fishy bout, yall. we found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. i gotta say, aint never heard of no black bounty hunter before. a black boy paid to kill white men how did ya like that line of work django retorts, upside down. django well, it turns out i was a natural. ace woody laughs. ace woody boy, people round here are cross wit you. ace woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body length from the hanging man. ace woody see boss man was a rather beloved figure round here. now hes dead as fried chicken, everyone round here blames you. ace woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist, he carries a huge bowie knife ina shoulder holster. he removes the big blade from its sheath. ace woody yep, boss mans gone. poor calvin. poor goddamn calvin. were burnin him in a few hours. at sunset. should be real pretty. however ... . i dont think youre gonna be able to attend. ace takes the bowie knife and throws it... . it lands stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from djangos face. ace woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and django, pulls the blade out of the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down. as he does this, he says ace woody now i understand you didnt really have nuttin to do wit it. its that german sunbitch the trouble maker. you just wanted to git your girl, and hightail your nigger asses outta here. now i appreciate that. but grieving folks round here need someone to blame. and i guess they figure if you hadnt brought your black ass round here in the first place, boss man still be alive. and you know what, they got a point. he throws the knife again... .this time it lands in the floor two inches from djangos face. he walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool. as he does he says ace woody now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways, believe me when i. tell you, i know every goddamn trick in the book. now theres a lotta ass busters out there try an git creative with the way they bust ass. but me... .i always found the best methods are, tried and true. he throws the knife again... django jerks his head back ... .and the knife lands in the floor, right where djangos head was. ace woody stands up, walks the floor to the bowie, yanks it out of the wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man. ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy. ace woody you know blackie, here at candyland, i had me a real sweet deal. these last eleven years training calvins mandingos i made me more money i made my whole goddamn life. and no end in sight, neither. beat then you came along. knocked me right off that perch i was sittin pretty on. you think miss lara gonna be as.interested in mandingos as her brother uuummmm...i dont think so. what i think, is you done fucked up my good thang. so when it comes to you, django boy, you could say i gotta axe to grind. ijs he grabs a handfull of djangos genitals in his fist. he takes his big bowie, and places the razor sharp blade against djangos nut sack. django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole. ace woody hows the blade of that bowie feel against your ball sack, blackie a bowie right off the wet stone. now thats what i call sharp. django dances some more ... ace woody yep nigger, im gonna snip them nuts. breath on the count of three. django screams django no ace woody one ... django no dont do it ace woody got to do it, boy. two... django no  just then stephen appears in the entrance of the barnblacksmith facility. hes holding djangos clothes in a bundle under his arm. stephen capt, miss lara lookin for you. she wanna talk about the old mans funeral. oh, and she changed her mind bout snippin django. she gonna give em to the lequint dickey people. while still keeping a firm grip on djangosjunk, ace woody says ace woody well she didnt waste a minute tellin me. ace woody looks down at django, both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened. ace woody to django how disappointing. 171 ace woody to stephen where she at stephen she in the big house. the kitchen. ace turns to leave, stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn, and begins poking a long poker which lies buried in the fire. djangos clothes are dumped by the furnace. ace woody you gonna look after our friend as, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says stephen oh yes sirree bob, you know i am 01 snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know, gonna have us a big of chat. he removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, its red hot end glows orange. stephen snowballs just makin sure his talking stick is all nice and frosty. ace woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn. just stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down django, alone. with the red hot poker in his hand snowball approaches the naked hanging django. stephen i bet you an that german thought yall was on easy street for awhile  didnt ya yall track hildi to the old man. you get the idea to go to greenville  look up the ole man there. breath that was a good idea. i bet yall couldnt believe how easy it was. you meet moguy, he buys your horseshit. ya git your ass invited to candyland, no fuss no muss. ya ride the whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser. then ya ride in to candyland  ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking big house. 137 stephen beat and thats where you met me. and thats when you knew your goose was cooked. he touches djangos nipple with the orange hot tip of the poker. unlike a lot of movie heros, django doesnt take torture silently and stoically. this shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot poker. stephen now that fancy talkin white man of yours didnt know whats what. he still thought his ass hadda chance. but like the oneeyed charly you are, you always know the end is near fore the white folks. with the orange hot poker, he burns off djangos other nipple. the smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils. stephen damn nigger, you smell good. he walks behind django with the poker. stephen you know, when you was sittin on that feather bed in the quest room in the big house  after you slapped my ass to the floor you were sayin something bout my bare black ass, and how you were gonna bust it. remember that, bright boy he places the hot orange end of the poker hard against djangos bare buttocks. django screams stephen laughs. stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. he goes through djangos clothes and pulls out his tan pants. he tosses them on the floor by the hanging man. stephen you leavin, thats what you can take with you. stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to him, he begins fondling djangos genitals. i31 stephen now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours. seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin up with different ways to kill your ass. now most of dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts. but while that might seem like a good idea. truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out. then i say hells bells, the niggers we send to lequint dickey, got it worse then that. then theyre, lets whip em to death, throw em to the mandingos, feed em to stonesiphers dogs. and then i say, whats so special bout that we do that shit all the time. hells bells, the niggers we send to lequint dickey got it worse then that. he stops massaging djangos balls. stephen so miss lara got the bright idea of givin your ass to the lequint dickey mining company. and as a slave of the lequint dickey mining company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks. and trust me when i tell you its gonna be bout as much fun as it sounds. we sell em the mandingos aint good for nuttin no more. like them three yall came back with. for them big garboons we get twenty a piece. they last bout six months. skinny nigger like you, i give two or three. stephen turns to leave. django wheres broomhilda stephen shes all right for now. miss lara soft hearted on er. she gave her to billy crash. he was sweet on er. now billy crash might not look or smell too good, but aint nobody gonna bother her. stephen limps away. cut to 137 ext  candyland  afternoon the caravan coming from the lequint dickey mining company comes riding up to the plantation. it comes equipped with one cage wagon from a

gun and your belt. floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over to django handing it to him. django accepts it. about the pistol, floyd tells django floyd now dont drop it now. i just had the sights fixed last month, its perfect. django holding the gunbelt in his hand. django thats good to know. without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, django shoots floyd twice in the chest... roy turns around... django takes the gun out of the holster... . bam...roy is hit in the upper brain area and falls to the grass dead. jano goes for the gun on his hip. django shoots one of the saddle bags over.janos shoulder...kahboom jano is blown to smithereens... the kahboom knocks django on his ass... the cage wagon rodney, chester, and chicken charlie come down from the shock of the blast. the image outside the bars of their cage is of dust and smoke in the air, obscuring all visibility... then ... a sudden gust of wind comes and blows all the smoke and dust away, revealing in bright color focus... .django standing among the two dead aussies, and whatever is left of jano. hes shoeless and shirtless, but floyds pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist. he locks eyes with the three men in the cage.. he then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast, and climbs aboard him bareback. he leans over and snatches the rifle that floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him. grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the beasts side. the pack animals springs to life under the new rider. by now it should be apparent that django brings the best out of horses, and horses bring the best out of django. from his high horse django looks down at the three caged men... .then... using the rifle in a quick one handed move he shoots the lock on the cage door. he looks at the three men, especially rodney, then says django throw up that dynamite. rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to django on his horse. django wraps it around the horses neck, turns the beast around, and without saying another word, rides back in the direction of candyland. the three now free mandingos, watch him ride away. who was that nigger cut to l.rz a gorgeous big sky southern purple and orange sunset we pan down from the sky and see in small black silhouette the funeral procession of calvin candie carrying the coffin of the former master up the hill on candyland that leads to the graveyard. a white preacher walks out in front of the procession. then comes calvin candies coffin carried by eight pallbearers, stephen, moguy, bartholomew, ace woody, brown, cody, and his best mandingos samson and goldie. the first mourner in line is lara lee dressed in a fancy black dress, wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black mammy cora crying at her side. cora the skys real pretty miss lara. monsieur candie think it real nice. lara lee ah, bless you sweet innocent cora. we cross cut with shots of django riding the horse on the way back to candyland. the bare backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the rifle in one hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a gorgeous sunset sky, looks like an indian. ext  tracker shackbunkhouse  sunset the same gorgeous sunset sky over the same shitty tracker shack bunkhouse that mr.stonesipher and his three obscure companions share. the german shepherds including marsha rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse. int  tracker shack  sunset the four trackers are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards. mr.stonesipher, lex, and stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of your cards is different. instead of chips they play with, nigger ears yes, the ears of slaves. on a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at candyland are missing one ear. jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small delicate birdhouse hes making. ext  woodsoutside the shack  sunset insert horse hoofs walking then stopping. djangos bare feet jump on to the ground. is3 int  dog kennel  sunset the four dogs lay out... . when, marsha hears something, and raises her head... shirtless django moves quietly through the woods. marsha rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three pals continue to lay out. django by a tree he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the long handle axe buried in the chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way. marsha bark the other three dogs wake up, and go on alert. django disappears. int  tracker shack  sunset they hear the barking inside. mr.stonesipher jake jake building his birdhouse. jake yeah mr.stonesipher check on marsha. jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to check on them these guys are very sensitive about their dogs. ext  tracker shack as the barking gets louder, we see a close up of the axe in the chopping block, and djangos hand removing it. jake opens the bunkhouse doorhe sees directly a hundred feet in front of him, django standing there with the axe. just as he reacts... django ... . throws the axe... jake ... . it hits him in the face. after letting go of the axe handle, django runs full speed toward jake. before the other three have really registered whats happening, django has crossed the distance, and is yanking the axe out of jakes face. and with axe in hand, django chases and fights with all three trackers, till after a point where hes chopped down two of them, lex, and stew, and now theres only mr.stonesipher left. but mr.stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic buck knife, and is able to fight back against django. you know stonesiphers great with a knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack attack. django uses the axe handle in a defensive position. the expert mountain boy begins scoring blade cuts on shirtless django. the two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. then its just a fight of brute strength, and survival. mr.stonesipher is physically bigger then django. but if djangos going to save broomhilda, not to mention get revenge on all these candyland motherfuckers, he has to take stonesiphers ass out. this black man who has been under the yoke of white mans domination all his life, and this white man who feeds black people to dogs, fight each other for their life. django gets his arm around stonesiphers neck in a headlock, but the mountain boy is big enough to lift django. so like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life, django tightens his lock around his opponents neck. django gets his hand on the hammer jake was building the birdhouse with, and brings it crashing down on the top of stonesiphers head. that weakens stonesipher. he hits him again in the head. that drops stonesipher to his knees. he hits him again with the hammer on the head. that puts the mountain man down on his back. he hits him one more time with the hammer to keep him down for good. the trackers are all dead. only the dogs mad barking remains. ext  the funeral  night the funeral for calvin candie is underway. the preacher reads some words over him. ext  tracker shack  night django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps out of the shack. he takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks over to the water pump. marsha and her three friendscontinue to bark like mad. he pumps a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. he begins washing the bloodoffof himself. as he washes, he says outloud django what ya doin around here, boy timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes. timmy i was just walkin by. django wanna help me out timmy sure. django my woman, hildi, is with billy crash. you know where his shack is timmy sure do. django you show me timmy will i get in trouble django not by the time i get through killin everybody. timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. he believes him. timmy ill show ya. then ... django turns towards the barking dogs. he turns back to timmy and asks django you know what toadstools look like 15c timmy sure do. django go pick me a mess of em. insert timmy picking toadstools poison mushroms. insert django stirring a big pot of beef stew with a wooden spoon in the tracker shack. timmy comesin carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt. django takes the toadstools and mr.stonesiphers buck knife and chops the mushrooms into tiny pieces. he tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and mixes it up with the spoon. ext  marshas kennel  night django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel. it lands on the ground with a plop. the angry dogs, are nevertheless, still dogs, and greedily scarf up the stew. django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile. django you bit your last nigger, bitch bite on that. django lifts timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse. django first things first, boy. take me to my horse. ext  funeral night the funeral is in full melodramatic bore. tnt  stableblacksmith  night timmy brings django to the stable on the candyland grounds. django goes straight up to the stall housing tony and says hello. tonys happy to see him. django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him. he turns and sees the body of dr.schultz lying in a heap. and schultzs horse fritz in the stable. django saddle up fritz and tony. timmy just stares. django now, boy timmy hops to work. django bends down over the body of dr.schultz, he takes broomhildas bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. he also searches for and finds schultzs hidden derringer, he keeps it in a holster around his ankle. as timmy saddles the horses, he asks timmy do you feel bad for your friend django rises from the body of his friend. django yeah, i do. as timmy saddles the horses he says timmy i know just how ya feel. i lost a white friend once. he drowned in the lake. django doesnt correct the difference between dr.schultz and a white friend, because theres nothing he could say to timmy to make him understand. he goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the furnace. he puts on his boots. his green jacket over his bare chest. and finally his hat. ext  the funeral  night the service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands, and beginning to leave. int  billy crashs shack  night billy crash is in bed fucking broomhilda. she doesnt wail, she doesnt make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water. as billys fucking her he says billy crash its gonna be real nice round here now the ol mans gone. cont sr billy crash fucks would you stop your galdarn cryin he stops fucking in frustration broomhilda i cant. billy crash now girl, im tryin to be nice. broomhilda i cant help it im really sad he

always been sweet on you. i dont wanna bust your ass. so dont make me now im gonna go shit. you calm down. he exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving broomhilda alone. we move into a close up of broomhilda lying on the bed. she cries for django, she cries for herself... .then... she hears an impact sound, and a muffled ooomph sound. and through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in billy crashs shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground. then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door. cu broomhilda her face, stained with tears, watches the door. a soft knock knock on the door. broomhilda softly yes the voice on the other side of the door, says djangos voice os hey little trouble maker. 157 she hops out of bed, and throws open the door... there he is, she runs into his arms. ext  the funeral  night the two old slave.grave diggers are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on monsieur calvin j. candies coffin. the participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. the funeral is a private affair, just the candie family unit, some of the overseers, and the slaves. no one from town, except the preacher. the slave mourners begin. to move towards their living area, all saying goodbye to miss lara. miss lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them. a little cognizant of the candie family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house. ext  billy crashs shack  night django with broomhilda. billy crash lies dead in the b.g., stonesiphers buck knife buried deep in his chest. he hands broomhilda her papers. django heres your bill of sale, and freedom papers. no matter what happens to me, hold on to these and get out of the south. broomhilda whats gonna happen to you django

funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house. 60 ext  the trail back to the big house  night the family unit of the late calvin candie and his sister lara lee walk back to the big house for a drink. this candie family unit consists of lara lee unarmed in her black flowing funeral dress. cora unarmed her mammy, walks with miss lara, holding her hand. stephen. unarmed dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal house nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress miss lara, holding her other hand. ace woody armed with a gun belt.around his hip dressed in his wyatt earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself. leonide moguy armed with a gun belt around his hip walks by himself. bartholomew unarmed dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with his hat, walks alone. brown and jingle bells cody both armed with guns on their hips both dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together. and finally, samson and goldie unarmed calvin candies two prized mandingos, wearing suits they borrowed from bartholomew.. this candie family unit walk to the big house for a few post funeral drinks. they enter the lawn in front of the big house, and head for the front door. broomhilda on fritz and timmy riding on tony come along the side of the property by some shed. they see the candie family unit, all dressed in their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of the big house. the woman and little boy stop. but the group of enemies arent looking their way. the candie family unit moves closer towards the front of the big house... when ... the front of the big house explodes knocking the.candie family unit flat on their collective asses. broomhilda and timmy cant believe their eyes. i6 i wood  stone  plaster  dirt  dust  glass  smoke  gunpowder hang in the air. the candie family unit starts coming to their senses. nobody was killed, or even seriously hurt unless you count eardrums, just stunned. as their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust. thesmoke and dust thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated, but the big house front steps remain. cue cool music. stephen sees something in the smoke, squints. ace woody sees something in the smoke, squints. brown and cody see something in the smoke, squint. in the smoke and dust we begin to see a figure, walking towards them. ace woody squints at the figure. moguy sees the.figure. cora attending to miss lara sees the figure, then miss lara sees it. the figure moves further out of the smoke and dust. ace woody, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist. then he sees the figure.is carrying something in his left hand... .its floyds winchester, he raises it, and points it at ace. ace woodys hand moves away from his gun. the figure steps out of the smoke. its django dressed in his django outfit. stephen, ace woody, moguy, lara lee, bartholomew, cora, brown and jingle bells cody, sampson or goldie...nobody can believe djangos standing there. he stands at the top of the front steps of the big house, looking down at the candie family unit, all lying on the front lawn, winchester rifle held casually in his left hand. his right hand held casually by the gun on his hip. the candie family unit all on their ass in the grass, look up at django with a mixture of wonder, fear, and hate. icz we move into a romantic close up of broomhilda as she watches this. as django looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on the big house front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him. the black man in the cool green jacket says django i bet i.know what youre thinkin, ace woody

django everybody stand up its now django who gives the orders. they stand up quickly. django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at the candie family unit. enjoying their collective hatred. then... he tosses the rifle away. then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a showdown stance. everybody realizes djangos intentions. even broomhilda and timmy. django looks down from his position at the top of the big house steps at the ten people, and says django all black folks, take ten steps away from the white folks. djangos eyes go to stephen, who looks back at him. django not you stephen. youre right where you belong. 163 the black folks, cora, bartholomew, samson, and goldie begin taking ten steps away from the white folks and the gunfight. lara lee

fathom what theyjust witnessed. 65 all the candie family unit lies on the grass shot. but some are still alive. we hear moaning coming from lara lee, cody, and moguy. django sees this. the black man reaches behind him and comes out with a dynamite stick. he tosses it on the grass among the bodies. he takes aim with his pistol and fires. it explodes. finishing off what was left of the candie family unit, not to mention, blowing the limbs off of many of them. the lawn is silent. djangos pistol goes back in its holster. django walks down the front steps of the big house, feeling tremendous satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on candie and co. he removes dr.schultzs tiny derringer from stephens dead hand, putting it in his pocket. then heads over to where broomhilda and timmy wait

jammed, theres a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. two of these people are a young man and a young woman. the young man has a slight workingclass english accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like theyre going out of style. it is impossible to tell where the young woman is from or how old she is everything she does contradicts something she did. the boy and girl sit in a booth. their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace his girl friday fashion. young man no, forget it, its too risky. im through doin that shit. young woman you always say that, the same thing every time never again, im through, too dangerous. young man i know thats what i always say. im always right too, but  young woman  but you forget about it in a day or two  young man  yeah, well, the days of me forgittin are over, and the days of me rememberin have just begun. young woman when you go on like this, you know what you sound like young man i sound like a sensible fucking man, is what i sound like. young woman you sound like a duck. imitates a duck quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack... young man well take heart, cause youre never gonna hafta hear it again. because since im never gonna do it again, youre never gonna hafta hear me quack about how im never gonna do it again. young woman after tonight. the boy and girl laugh,

young woman oh yes, thank you. the waitress pours the young womans coffee. the young man lights up another cigarette. young man im doin fine. the waitress leaves. the young man takes a drag off of his smoke. the young woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. the young man goes right back into it. young man i mean the way it is now, youre takin the same fuckin risk as when you rob a bank. you take more of a risk. banks are easier  federal banks arent supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. theyre insured, why should they care you dont even need a gun in a federal bank. i heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said we got this guys little girl, and if you dont give him all your money, were gonna kill er. young woman did it work young man fuckin a it worked, thats what im talkin about knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin phone, cleans the place out, and they dont lift a fuckin finger. young woman did they hurt the little girl young man i dont know. there probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isnt the little girl. the point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone. young woman you wanna rob banks young man im not sayin i wanna rob banks, im just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin. young woman so you dont want to be a bank robber young man naw, all those guys are goin down the same road, either dead or servin twenty. young woman and no more liquor stores young man what have we been talking about yeah, no moreliquorstores. besides, it aint the giggle it usta be. too many foreigners own liquor stores. vietnamese, koreans, they cant fuckin speak english. you tell em empty out the register, and they dont know what it fuckin means. they make it too personal. we keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers gonna make us kill em. young woman im not gonna kill anybody. young man i dont wanna kill anybody either. but theyll probably put us in a situation where its us of them. and if its not the gooks, it these old jews whove owned the store for fifteen fuckin generations. ya got grandpa irving sittin behind the counter with a fuckin magnum. try walkin into one of those stores with nothin but a telephone, see how far it gets you. fuck it, forget it, were out of it. young woman well, what else is there, day jobs young man laughing not this life. young woman well what then he calls to the waitress. young man garcon coffee then looks to his girl. young man this place. the waitress comes by, pouring him some more. waitress snotty garcon means boy. she splits. young woman here its a coffee shop. young man whats wrong with that people never rob restaurants, why not bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin up one of them. restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. theyre not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting. young woman taking to idea i bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor. young man correct. just like banks, these places are insured. the managers dont give a fuck, theyre just tryin to get ya out the door before you start pluggin diners.  waitresses, forget it, they aint takin a bullet for the register. busboys, some wetback gettin paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck youre stealin from the owner. customers are sittin there with food in their mouths, they dont know whats goin on. one minute theyre havin a denver omelet, next minute somebodys stickin a gun in their face. the young woman visibly takes in the idea. the young man continues in a low voice. young man see, i got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. member all those customers kept comin in young woman yeah. young man then you got the idea to take everybodys wallet. young woman uhhuh. young man that was a good idea. young woman thanks. young man we made more from the wallets then we did the register. young woman yes we did. young man a lot of people go to restaurants. young woman a lot of wallets. young man pretty smart, huh the young woman scans the restaurant with this new information. she sees all the patrons eating, lost in conversations. the tired waitress, taking orders. the busboys going through the

whaddya mean vincent you dont be givin marsellus wallaces new bride a foot massage. jules you dont think he overreacted vincent antwan probably didnt expect marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction. jules it was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, i give my mother a foot massage. vincent its laying hands on marsellus wallaces new wife in a familiar way. is it as bad as eatin her out  no, but youre in the same fuckin ballpark. jules stops vincent. jules whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there.  eatin a bitch out, and givin a bitch a foot massage aint even the same fuckin thing. vincent not the same thing, the same ballpark. jules it aint no ballpark either. look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin his ladys feet, and stickin your

vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. the two men empty their guns at the same time

run for their money. theyre all basically the same. decor out of an archie comic book, golden oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the fats domino cheeseburger, or the wolfman jack omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit. but then theres jackrabbit slims, the big mama of 50s diners. either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view. vincents malibu pulls up to the restaurant. a big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the

over the wall rock all night, high school confidential, attack of the crab monster, and machine gun kelly. the booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars. in the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. a big sign on the wall states, no shoes allowed. some wannabe beboppers actually melrosetypes, do the twist in their socks or barefeet. the picture windows dont look out the street, but instead, b  w movies of 50s street scenes play behind them. the waitresses and waiters are made up as replicas of 50s icons marilyn monroe, zorro, james dean, donna reed, martin and lewis, and the philip morris midget, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes. vincent and mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 59 edsel. buddy holly their waiter, comes over,

into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. marilyn is squealing, the midget is paging philip morris, donna reed is making her customers drink their milk, and dean and jerry are acting a fool. mia whaddya think vincent its like a wax museum with a pulse rate. vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. after a second of watching him  mia what

hands her the rolled smoke. she takes it, putting it to her lips. out of nowhere appears a zippo lighter in vincents hand. he lights it. mia thanks. vincent think nothing of it. he begins rolling one for himself. as this time, the sound of a subway car fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle. marilyn monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. an imaginary subway train blows the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. the entire restaurant applauds. back to mia and vincent. mia marsellus said you just got back from amsterdam. vincent sure did. i heard you did a pilot. mia that was my fifteen minutes. vincent what was it mia it was show about a team of female secret agents called fox force five. vincent what mia fox force five. fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks. force, as in were a force to be reckoned with. five, as in theres one... two ... three... four... five of us. there was a blonde one, sommerset oneal from that show baton rouge, she was the leader. a japanese one, a black one, a french one and a brunette one, me.  we all had special skills. sommerset had a photographic memory, the japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the french fox specialty was sex... vincent what was your specialty mia knives. the character i played, raven mccoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. so she grew up doing a knife act. according to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. but because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. she could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist  when youre keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artists gonna come in handy. and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. if we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke. vincent do you remember any of the jokes mia well i only got the chance to say one, cause we only did one show. vincent tell me. mia no. its really corny. vincent cmon, dont be that way. mia no. you wont like it and ill be embarrassed. vincent you told it in front of fifty million people and you cant tell it to me i promise i wont laugh. mia laughing thats what im afraid of. vincent thats not what i meant and you know it. mia youre quite the silver tongue devil, arent you vincent i meant i wouldnt laugh at you. mia thats not what you said vince. well now im definitely not gonna tell ya, cause its been built up too much. vincent what a gyp. buddy comes back with the drinks. mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake. mia yummy vincent can i have a sip of that id like to know what a fivedollar shake tastes like. mia be my guest. she slides the shake over to him. mia you can use my straw, i dont have kooties. vincent smiles. vincent yeah, but maybe i do. mia kooties i can handle. he takes a sip. vincent goddamn thats a pretty fuckin good milk shake. mia told ya. vincent i dont know if its worth five dollars, but its pretty fuckin good. he slides the shake back. then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens. mia dont you hate that vincent what mia uncomfortable silences. why do we feel its necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable vincent i dont know. mia thats when you know you found somebody special. when you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence. vincent i dont think were there yet. but dont feel bad, we just met each other. mia well ill tell you what, ill go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say. vincent ill do that. int. jackrabbit slims ladies room  night mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. her head jerks up from the rush. mia imitating steppenwolf i said goddamn int. jackrabbit slims dining area  night vincent digs into his douglas sirk steak. as he chews, his eyes scan the hellsapopinish restaurant. mia comes back to the table. mia dont you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you vincent were lucky we got it at all. buddy holly doesnt seem to be much of a waiter. we shoulda sat in marilyn monroes section. mia which one, theres two marilyn monroes. vincent no theres not. pointing at marilyn in the white dress serving a table. vincent thats marilyn monroe... then, pointing at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of film geeks  vincent ... and thats mamie van doren. i dont see jayne mansfield, so it must be her night off. mia pretty smart. vincent i have moments. mia did ya think of something to say vincent actually, theres something ive wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and i didnt want to offend you. mia oooohhhh, this doesnt sound like mindless, boring, gettingtoknow you chitchat. this sounds like you actually have something to say. vincent only if you promise not to get offended. mia you cant promise something like that. i have no idea what youre gonna ask. you could ask me what youre gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. then, through no fault of my own, i woulda broken my promise. vincent then lets just forget it. mia that is an impossibility. trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility. vincent is that a fact mia nods her head yes. mia besides, its more exciting when you dont have permission. vincent what do you think about what happened to antwan mia whos antwan vincent tony rocky horror. mia he fell out of a window. vincent thats one way to say it. another way is, he was thrown out. another was is, he was thrown out by marsellus. and even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you. mia is that a fact vincent no its not, its just what i heard. mia who told you this vincent they. mia and vincent smile. mia they talk a lot, dont they vincent they certainly do. mia well dont by shy vincent, what exactly did they say vincent is slow to answer. mia let me help you bashful, did it involve the fword vincent no. they just said rocky horror gave you a foot massage. mia and... vincent no and, thats it. mia you heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a fourstory window because he massaged my feet vincent yeah. mia and you believed that vincent at the time i was told, it seemed reasonable. mia marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable vincent no, it seemed excessive. but that doesnt mean it didnt happen. i heard marsellus is very protective of you. mia a husband being protective of his wife is one thing. a husband almost killing another man for touching his wifes feet is something else. vincent but did it happen mia the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. i met anwan once  at my wedding  then never again.  the truth is, nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and tony rocky horror. but when you scamps get together, youre worse than a sewing

previous scene. they finish their little dance, laughing. then... the two just stand face to face looking at each other. vincent was than an uncomfortable silence mia i dont know what that was. pause music and drinks mia moves away to attend to both. vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove. vincent im gonna take a piss. mia that was a little bit more information than i needed to know, but go right ahead. vincent shuffles off to the john. mia moves to her cd player, thumbs through a stack of cds and selects one k.d. lang. the speakers blast out a high energy country number, which mia plays airguitar to. she dances her way around the room and finds herself by vincents overcoat hanging on the rack. she touches its sleeve. it feels good. her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. mia thinks so anyway. her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his zippo lighter. she slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancystyle like vince did. what do you know, she did it mias one happy clam. she triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the zippo closed. the miamade cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. her hand slides the zippo back in the overcoat pocket. but wait, her fingers touch something else. those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that vincent bought earlier from lance. wearing a big smile, mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. mia like you would say bingo disco vince, you little cola nut, youve been holding out on me. cut to int. bathroom marsellus wallaces house  night vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror. vincent one drink and leave. dont be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road. living room mia has the unbeknownsttoher heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human dustbuster, she quickly snorts the fat line. closeup  mia her head jerks back. her hands go to her nose which feels like its on fucking fire, something is terribly wrong. then... the rush hits... bathroom vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. vincent ...its a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. because when people are loyal to each other, thats very meaningful. living room mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but its like shes trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. blood begins to drip from mias nose. then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits. bathroom vince continues. vincent so youre gonna go out there, drink your drink, say goodnight, ive had a very lovely evening, go home, and jack off.  and thats all youre gonna do. now that hes given himself a little pep talk, vincents ready for whatevers waiting for him on the other side of that door. so he goes through it. living room we follow behind vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. shes twisted on her back. blood and puke are down her front. and her face is contorted. not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. slackjawed. vincent jesus christ vincent moves like greased lightning to mias fallen body. bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. she slightly stirs. mia is aware of vincent over her, speaking to her. vincent sounding weird mia mia what the hell happened but shes unable to communicate mia makes a few lost mumbles, but theyre not distinctive enough to be called words. vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story. vincent to himself ill be a sonofabitch. to mia mia mia what did you take answer me honey, what did you take mia is incapable of answering. he slaps her face hard. vincent springs up and runs to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. he goes through the pockets frantically. its gone. vincent makes a beeline to mia. we follow. vincent yelling to mia okay honey, were getting you on your feet. he reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms. vincent were on our feet now, and now were gonna talk out to the car. here we go, watch us walk. we follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically unconscious mia through the house and out the front door. ext. vincents hot rod moving  night insert speedometer red needle on a hundred. vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature. he sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn out but comfortable teeshirt that has, written on it, taft, california, and a mothridden terry cloth robe. in his hand is a bowl of capn crunch with crunch berries. in front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the capn crunch with crunch berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray. on the bigscreen tv in front of the table is the three stooges, and theyre getting married. preacher emil simkus on tv hold hands, you love birds. the phone rings. lance puts down his

look, just keep talkin to her, okay while shes gettin the shot, i gotta get a medical book. vincent what do you need a medical book for lance to tell me how to do it. ive never given an adrenaline

then get it. lance i am, if youll let me. vincent im not fuckin stoppin you. lance stop talkin to me, and start talkin to her. we follow lance as he runs out of the living room into a... int. spare room with a bunch of junk in it. he frantically starts scanning the junk for the book hes looking for, repeating the words, come on, endlessly. from off screen we hear vincent o.s. hurry up man were

living room. living room vincent is bent over mia, talking softly to her, when lance reenters the room. vincent quit fuckin around man and give her the shot lance bends down by the black case brought in by jody. he opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection. lance while im doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart. vince rips her blouse open. jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action. vincent does it have to be exact lance yeah, it has to be exact im giving her an injection in the heart, so i gotta exactly hit her in the heart. vincent well, i dont know exactly where her heart is, i think its here. vince points to mias right breast.  lance glances over and nods. lance thats it. as lance readies the injection, vincent looks up at jody. vincent i need a big fat magic marker, got one jody what vincent i need a big fat magic marker, any felt penll do, but a magic marker would be great. jody hold on. jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which bills, papers, pens spill to the floor. the injection is ready. lance hands vincent the needle. lance its ready, ill tell you what to do. vincent youre gonna give her the shot. lance no, youre gonna give her the shot. vincent ive never does this before. lance ive never done this before either, and i aint starting now. you brought er here, that means you give her the shot. the day i bring an oding bitch to your place, then i gotta give her the shot. jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand. jody got it. vincent grabs the magic marker out of jodys hand and makes a big red dot on mias body where her heart is. vincent okay, what do i do lance well, youre giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. but shes got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. so what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion. lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like the shape killing its victims in halloween. vincent i gotta stab her lance if you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. then once you do, push down on the plunger. vincent what happens after that lance im curious about that myself. vincent this aint a fuckin joke man lance shes supposed to come out of it like  snaps his fingers  that. vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. he looks down on mia. mia is fading fast. soon nothing will help her. vincents eyes narrow, ready to do this. vincent count to three. lance, on this knees right beside vincent, does not know what to expect. lance one... red dot on mias body. needle raised ready to strike. lance o.s. ...two... jodys face is alive with anticipation. needle in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. lance o.s. ...three the needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard. vincent brings the needle down hard, stabbing mia in the chest. mias head is jolted from the impact. the syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. mias eyes pop wide open and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. she bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest  screaming. vincent, lance and jody, who were in sitting positions in front of mia, jump back, scared to death. mias scream runs out. she slowly starts taking breaths of air. the other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if shes alright. lance if youre okay, say something. mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. mia something. vincent and lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death mia came. jody anybody

never ever hear of this incident. mia smiles. mia dont worry about it. if marsellus ever heard of this, id be in as much trouble as you. vincent i seriously doubt that. mia if you can keep a secret, so can i. vincent lets shake on it. the two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do. vincent mums the word. mia lets go of vincents hand and silently makes the seeno evil, hearnoevil, and speaknoevil sign with her hands. vincent smiles. vincent if youll excuse me, i gotta go home and have a heart attack. mia giggles. vincent turns to leave. mia you still wanna hear my fox force five joke vincent turns around. vincent sure, but i think im still a little too petrified to laugh. mia uhhuh. you wont laugh because its not funny. but if you still wanna hear it, ill tell it. vincent i cant wait. mia three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. the baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. the poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him  stamps on the ground  and says catch up. they both smile, but neither laugh. mia see ya round, vince. mia turns and walks inside her house. closeup  vincent after mia walks inside. vincent continues to look at where she was. he brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss. then exits frame leaving it empty. we

year 1972. butchs mother, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room. next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an american air force officer. the camera is the perspective of a fiveyear old boy. mother butch, stop watching tv a second. we got a special visitor. now do you remember when i told you your daddy dies in a p.o.w. camp butch o.s. uhhuh. mother well this here is capt. koons. he was in the p.o.w. camp with daddy. capt. koons steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boys eyeline. when koons speaks, he speaks with a slight texas accent. capt. koons hello, little man. boy i sure heard a bunch about you. see, i was a good friend of your daddys. we were in that hanoi pit of hell over five years together.  hopefully, youll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. if it had been me who had not made it, major coolidge would be talkin right now to my son jim. but the way it worked out is im talkin to you, butch. i got somethin for ya. the captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket. capt. koons this watch i got here was first purchased by your greatgranddaddy. it was bought during the first world war in a little general store in knoxville, tennessee. it was bought by private doughboy ernie coolidge the day he set sail for paris. it was your greatgranddaddys war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. you see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. your greatgranddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol coffee can. and in that can it stayed til your grandfather dane coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the germans once again. this time they called it world war two. your greatgranddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. unfortunately, danes luck wasnt as good as his old mans. your granddad was a marine and he was killed with all the other marines at the battle of wake island. your granddad was facing death and he knew it. none of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin that island alive. so three days before the japanese took the island, your 22year old grandfather asked a gunner on an air force transport named winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. three days later, your grandfather was dead. but winocki kept his word. after the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his dads gold watch. this watch. this watch was on your daddys wrist when he was shot down over hanoi. he was captured and put in a vietnamese prison camp. now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch itd be confiscated. the way your daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. and hed be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boys birthright. so he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin. his ass. five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. i hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. then, after seven years, i was sent home to my family. and now, little man, i give the watch to you. capt. koons hands the watch to butch. a little hand comes into frame to accept it. cut to int. locker room  night the 27year old butch coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia trunks, shoes and gloves. he lies on a table catching a few zzzzzzs before his big fight. almost as soon as we cut to him, he wakes up with a start. shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove. his trainer klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind klondike in the hallway. klondike its time, butch. butch im ready. klondike steps inside, closing the door on the wild mob outside. he goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. butch hops off the table and, without a word, klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back battling butch coolidge. the two men head for the door. klondike opens the door for butch. as butch steps into the hallway, the crowd goes apeshit. klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room. fade

room, except empty. we hear the shower running in the bathroom. the camera moves to the bathroom doorway. we see fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up. shes drying her head with a towel. butch is inside the shower washing up. we see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door. steam fills the bathroom. butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out. butch i think i cracked a rib. fabienne giving me oral pleasure butch no retard, from the fight. fabienne dont call me retard. butch in a mongoloid voice my name is fabby

going back in the bathroom. we stay on the wide shot of the unconscious butch in bed. fade to black fade up motel room  morning same shot as before, the next morning. we find butch still asleep in

screams in horror. butch looks toward her, suddenly calm. butch to fabienne no its not your fault. he approached her you left it at the apartment. he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. he touches her hand, she flinches. butch if you did leave it at the apartment, its not your fault. i had you bring a bunch of stuff. i reminded you about it, but i didnt illustrate how personal the watch was to me. if all i gave a fuck about was my watch, i shouldve told you. you aint a mind reader. he kisses her hand. then rises. fabienne is still sniffling. butch goes to the closet. fabienne im sorry. butch puts on his high school jacket. butch dont be. it just means i wont be able to eat breakfast with you. fabienne why does it mean that butch because im going back to my

sugar pop. fabienne bye. butch im gonna take your honda. fabienne okay. and with that, hes out the door. fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her. int. honda moving  day butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street. butch of all the fuckin things she coulda forgot, she forgets my fathers watch. i specifically reminded her not to forget it. bedside table  on the kangaroo. i said the words dont forget my fathers watch. ext. city street  day the little honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. cut to a parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour. ext. residential street corner  day butch isnt completely reckless. he has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin through the front door. ext. alley  day butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. ext. street  butchs apartment  day everything seems normal. more or less the right number of cars in the street. none of the parked cars appear out of place. none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of butchs home. butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. across the street from butchs building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant. a big sign sticks up in the air, with the name teriyaki donut and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice. ext. butchs apartment courtyard  day butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building. once again, everything appears normal  the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears disturbed. butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. he steps outside the door and listens inside. nothing. butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. int. butchs apartment  day his apartment hasnt been touched. he cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. obviously, no one is there. butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. with carton in hard, butch surveys the apartment. then he goes to the bedroom. his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean and anonymous. the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an olympic silver medal, a framed issue of ring magazine with butch on the cover, and a poster of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo. sure enough, theres the watch just like he said it was on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts. putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster. butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. what he sees is a small compact czech m61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. butch softly holy shit. he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. then... a toilet flushes. butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. there is someone behind it. like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, butch freezes, not knowing what to do. the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. in his hand is the book modesty blaise by peter odonnell. vincent and butch lock eyes. vincent freezes. butch doesnt move, except to point the m61 in vincents direction. neither man opens his mouth. then... the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts. thats all the situation needed. butchs finger hits the trigger. muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun. vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously  lifting him off his feet, propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger, vincent is annihilated. butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. with the respect it deserves, butch carefully places the m61 back on the kitchen counter. then he exits the apartment, quickly. ext. apartment courtyard  day butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... ...goes through the alley... ...and into his car in one steadicam shot. ext. honda  day butch cranks the car into gear and drives away. the big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face. ext. apartment building street  day the honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building. int. honda  day butch looks out the window at his former home. butch thats how youre gonna beat em, butch.  they keep underestimatin ya. this makes the boxer laugh out loud. as he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. when the music starts, he sings along with it. he drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from teriyaki donut. butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see through the windshield the big man himself, marsellus wallace, exit teriyaki donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. he steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of butchs car. this is the first time we see marsellus clearly. laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. when marsellus is in front of butchs car, he casually glances to his left, sees butch, continues walking... then stops doubletake am i really seeing what im seeing butch doesnt wait for the big man to answer his own question. he stomps on the gas pedal. the little honda slams into marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. butch cuts into cross traffic and is broadsided by a gold camaro z28, breaking all the windows in the honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was fabiennes honda. blood flows from his nostrils. the stillfunctional tape player continues to play. a pedestrian pokes his head inside. pedestrian jesus, are you okay butch look at him, spacedout. butch i guess. marsellus wallace lies sprawled out in the street. gawkers gather around the body. gawker 1 to the others hes dead hes dead this jerks yelling makes marsellus come to. two pedestrians help the shaken butch out of the wreckage. the woozy marsellus gets to his feet. gawker 2 if you need a witness in court, ill be glad to help. he was a drunken maniac. he hit you and crashed into that car. marsellus still incoherent who gawker 2 pointing at butch him. marsellus follows the gawkers finger and sees butch coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. marsellus well, ill be damned. the big man takes out a .45 automatic and the gawkers back away. marsellus starts moving toward butch. butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly beeline toward him. butch sacre bleu. marsellus brings up his weapon and fires, but hes so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild. he hits a lookyloo woman in the hip. she falls to the ground, screaming. lookyloo woman oh my god, ive been shot thats all butch needs to see. hes outta here. marsellus runs after him. the crowd looks agape. butch is in a mad, limping run. the big mans hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run. butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads masondixie pawnshop. int. masondixie pawnshop  day maynard, a hillbillylookin boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of butch races into his world. maynard can i help you wit somethin butch shut up butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door. maynard now you just wait one goddamn minute  before maynard can finish his threat, marsellus charges in. he doesnt get past the doorway because butch lands his fist in marsellus face. the gangsters feet go out from under him and the big man falls flat on his back. outside, two police cars with their sirens blaring race by. butch pounces on the fallen body, punching him twice more in the face. butch takes the gun out of marsellus hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger. butch so you like chasing people, huh he breaks the finger. marsellus lets out a pain sound.  butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, pulls back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter. butch well guess what, big man, you caught me  maynard o.s.  hold it right there, godammit butch and marsellus look up at maynard, whos brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men. butch look mister, this aint any of your business  maynard  im makin it my business now toss that gun butch does. maynard now you on top, stand up and come to the counter. butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. as soon as he gets there, maynard hauls off, hitting him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking butch down and out. after butch goes down, maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone. marsellus wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. then it picks up. maynard zed its maynard. the spider just caught a coupla flies. marsellus passes out. fade to black fade up int. pawnshop back room  day two shot  butch and marsellus they are tied up in two separate chairs. in their mouths are two smstyle ball gags a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths. both men are unconscious. maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until theyre wide awake and wet as otters. the two prisoners look up at their captors. maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and marsellus .45 sticking in his belt. maynard nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or zed. a buzzer buzzes. maynard thats zed. without saying another word, maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them. we hear, on the other side of the curtains, maynard let zed inside the store. butch and marsellus look around the room. the basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. after taking in their predicament, butch and marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what theyve gotten themselves into. maynard and zed come through the curtains. zed is an even more intense version of maynard, if such a thing is possible. the two hillbillys are obviously brothers. where maynard is a vicious pitbull, zed is a deadly cobra. zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. he inspects them for a long time, then says zed to maynard you said you waited for me maynard i did. zed then how come theyre all beat up maynard they did that to each other. they was fightin when they came in. this one was gonna shoot that one. zed to butch you were gonna shoot him butch makes no reply. zed hey, is grace gonna be okay in front of this place maynard yeah, it aint tuesday is it zed no, its thursday. maynard then shell be fine. zed bring out the gimp. maynard i think the gimps sleepin. zed well, i guess youll just wake em up then, wont you maynard opens a trap door in the floor. maynard yelling in the hole wake up maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash. he gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises the gimp. the gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. there are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. on his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper closed for a mouth. they keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog. zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. maynard hands the gimps leash to zed, then backs away. maynard to the gimp down the gimp gets on its knees. maynard hangs back while zed appraises the two men. maynard whos first zed i aint fer sure yet. then with his little finger, zed does a silent eenie, meany, miney, moe...  just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two. butch are marsellus are terrified. maynard looks back and forth at the victims. the gimpss eyes go from one to the other inside the mask. zed continues his silent singsong with his finger moving left to right, then it stops. two shot  butch and marsellus after a beat, the camera moves to the right, zeroing in on marsellus. zed stands up. zed wanna do it here maynard naw, drag big boy to russells old room. zed grabs marsellus chair and drags him into russells old room. russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the masondixie pawnshop. whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. as marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russells old room. maynard to the gimp up the gimp rises. maynard ties the gimps leash to a hook on the ceiling. maynard keep an eye on this one. the gimp bows its head yes. maynard disappears into russells old room. there must be a stereo in there because suddenly the judds, singing in harmony, fills the air. butch looks at the gimp. the gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. from behind the door we hear country music, struggling, and maynard o.s. whoa, this boys got a bit of fight in em we the hear maynard and zed beat on marsellus. zed o.s. you wanna fight you wanna fight good, i like to fight butch pauses, listens to the voices. then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free. the gimp is laughing wildly. the ropes are on too tight and butch cant break free. the gimp slaps his knee laughing in the back room, we hear maynard o.s. thats it... thats it boy, youre goin fine. oooooooh, just like that... thats good. grunting faster stay still... stay still goddamn ya zed goddammit, git over here and hold em butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt. the gimp sees this and its eyes widen. the gimp huhng the gimp flails wildly, trying to get the leash off the hook. he tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three boxers punches to its face. the punches knock the gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook, butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains. int. pawnshop  day butch sneaks to the door. on the counter is a big set of keys with a large z connected to the ring. grabbing them, hes about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with marsellus. butch decides for the life of him, he cant leave anybody in a situation like that. se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies heads in with. he picks up a big destructivelooking hammer, then discards it not destructive enough. he picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. next, a large louisville slugger he tries on for size. but then he spots what hes been looking for a samurai sword. it hands in its handcarved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon dads oldfashioned root beer sign. butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. its a magnificent piece of steel. it seems to glisten in the lowwattage light of the pawnshop. butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. not on your life. its as sharp as it gets. this weapon seems made to order for the brothers grimm downstairs. holding the sword pointed downward, takakura kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business. int. pawnshop back room  day butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. sodomy and the judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to russells old room. int. russells old room  day butchs hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. it swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. zed is now bent over marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. maynard watches. both have their backs to butch. maynard faces the camera, grinning, while butch comes up behind him with the sword. miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see butch coming up behind maynard. his eyes widen. butch hey hillbilly. maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword. butch screams... with one mighty swing, slashes maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on zed. maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. butch, while never taking his eyes off zed, thrusts the sword behind him, skewering maynard, then extracts it, pointing the blade toward zed. maynard collapses. zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butchs sword to marsellus .45 automatic, which lies within reach. butchs eyes follow zeds. butch you want that gun, zed pick it up. zeds hand inches toward the weapon. butch grips the sword tighter. zed studies butch. butch looks hard at zed. then a voice says marsellus o.s. step aside, butch. butch steps aside, revealing marsellus standing behind him, holding maynards pumpaction shotgun. kaboom zed is blasted in the groin. down he goes, screaming in agony. marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, ejects the used shotgun shell. butch lowers the sword and hangs back. not a word, until butch you okay marsellus naw man. im pretty fuckin far from okay long pause. butch what now marsellus what now well let me tell you what now.  im gonna call a couple pipe hittin niggers, wholl go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. to zed hear me talkin hillbilly boy i aint through with you by a damn sight. im gonna git medieval on your ass. butch i

one thing i ask  two things i ask dont tell nobody about this. this shits between me and you and the soontobelivin therestofhisshortasslifein agonizingpain, mr. rapist here. it aint nobody elses business. two leave town. tonight. right now. and when youre gone, stay gone.  youve lost your los angeles privileges. deal butch deal. the two men shake hands, then hug one another. marsellus go on now, get your ass outta here. butch leaves russells old room through the red curtains. marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number. marsellus into the phone hello mr. wolf, its marsellus. gotta bit of a situation. ext. masondixie pawnshop  day butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. he looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, zeds big chrome chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name grace on it. he climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big z on them and starts up the huge hog. it rumbles to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. butch twists the accelerator handle and speeds off. we cut back and forth between... int. butch and fabiennes hotel room  day fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a frankie says, relax teeshirt, singing along with music coming from a boom box. ext. city street  chopper moving  day butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named grace. he checks his fathers watch. it says 1030. the song in the motel room plays over this. ext. motel room  day butch rides up on grace. he hops off and runs inside the motel room, while we stay outside with the bike. fabienne o.s. butch, i was so worried butch honey, grab your radio and your purse and lets go fabienne o.s. but what about all our bags butch fuck the bags. well miss our train if we dont split now. fabienne o.s. is everything well are we in danger butch were cool. in fact, were super cool. but we gots to go. ill wait for you outside. butch runs out and hops back on the bike. fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse. when she sees butch on the chopper, she stops dead. fabienne where did you get this motorcycle butch he kickstarts it its a chopper, baby, hop on. fabienne slowly approaches the twowheel demon. fabienne what happened to my honda butch sorry baby, i crashed the honda. fabienne youre hurt butch i mightve broke my nose, no biggie. hop on. she doesnt move. butch looks at her. butch honey, we gotta hit the fuckin road fabienne starts to cry. butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. he turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. butch im

butch its a chopper. fabienne whose chopper is this butch zeds. fabienne whos zed butch zeds dead, baby, zeds dead. and with that, the two lovebirds peel away on grace, as the song on the boom box rises. fade to black title card jules vincent jimmie  the wolf title disappears. over black, we can hear in the distance, men talking. jules o.s. you ever read the bible, brett brett o.s. yes jules o.s. theres a passage i got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation ezekiel 2517. the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men... fade up int. bathroom  day were in the bathroom of the hollywood apartment we were in earlier. in fact, were there at exactly the same time. except this time, were in the bathroom with the fourth man. the fourth man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to whats being said on the other side of the door, tightly clutching his huge silver .357 magnum. jules o.s. ...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. bang bang boom pow bam bam bam bam bam the fourth man freaks out. he throws himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door. then he listens to them talk. vincent o.s. friend of

possible. and im sorry jules, but i dont think what happened this morning qualifies. jules dont you see, vince, that shit dont matter. youre judging this thing the wrong way. its not about what. it could be god stopped the bullets, he changed coke into pepsi, he found my fuckin car keys. you dont judge shit like this based on merit. whether or not what we experienced was an accordingtohoyle miracle is insignificant. what is significant is i felt gods touch, god got involved. vincent but why jules thats whats fuckin wit me i dont know why. but i cant go back to sleep. vincent so youre serious, youre really gonna quit jules the life, most definitely. vincent takes a bite of food. jules takes a sip of coffee in the b.g., we see a patron call the waitress. patron garcon coffee we

closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to pumpkin. pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. like a rattlesnake, jules free hand grabs the wrist of pumpkins gun hand, slamming it on the table. his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his .45 hand under pumpkins chin. honey bunny freaks out, waving her gun in jules direction. honey bunny let him go

blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. i been sayin that shit for

saw some shit this mornin made me think twice. now im thinkin, it could mean youre the evil man. and im the righteous man.  and mr. .45 here, hes the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. or is could by youre the righteous man and im the shepherd and its the world thats evil and selfish.  id like that. but that shit aint the truth. the truth is youre the weak. and im the tyranny of evil men. but im tryin. im tryin real hard to be a shepherd. jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to yolanda. she looks back. grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two run out the door. jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee. jules to himself its cold. he pushes it aside. vincent appears next to jules. vincent i think we oughta leave now. jules thats probably a good idea. vincent throws some money on the table and jules grabs the briefcase. then, to the amazement of the patrons, the waitresses, the cooks, the bus boys, and the manager, these two badass dudes  wearing uc santa cruz and im with stupid teeshirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 automatics  walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word. fade out the end'"

              "'ing credit sequence plays, complete with its own spaghetti western theme song, we see seven shirtless and shoeless black male slaves connected together with leg irons, being run, by two white male hillbillies on horseback. the location is somewhere in texas. the black men roy, big sid, benjamin, django, pudgy ralph, franklyn, and blueberry are slaves just recently purchased at the greenville slave auction in greenville mississippi. the white hillbillies are two slave traders called, the speck brothers ace and dicky. one of the seven slaves is our hero django... . hes fourth in the leg iron line. we may or may not notice a tiny small r burned into his cheek r for runaway, but we cant help but notice his back which has been slashed to ribbons by bull whip beatings. as the operatic opening theme song plays, we see a montage of misery and pain, as django and the other men are walked through blistering sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. bare feet step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. leg irons take the skin off ankles. as the credits play, django has a spaghetti western flashback. now spaghetti western flashbacks are never pretty, its usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters from his past. in this instance we see django in a slave pen at the greenville auction. django amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the cell door, his wife broomhilda being led to the auction block. he fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance, he can see broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he hears the auctioneer yell sold. then shes taken away to whereabouts unknown, never to be seen again. as the sun continues to beat down on djangos head, he remembers django in the slave pen with what seems like a one hundred and fifty slaves in a cell designed for forty. white men yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the structure. the ground floor is covered by the big money buyers who stand in front of the auction block. 2 django is moved into a line of slaves the black men, and their masters their white owners, and their sellers the white man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction block, as they wait for their turn on the block. a slave robbie, stand on the auction block in view of the room full of buyers, the seller sells, and the owners stand off to the side. django takes in the environment around him. django has never cared for white folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly. its djangos turn on the auction block as the theme song wails its tragic crescendo, django is brought up on the auction block. he.looks down at all the white people who want to buy niggers, who look up to him. his heart fills with poison. back to django walking in leg irons with his six other companions, walking across the blistering texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking.  .hating. the opening credit sequence end.  ext  woods  night its night time and the speck brothers, astride horses, keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward. its a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to create a little top light. its so dark, the slavers use the creek.bed to keep from getting lost. both speck brothers carry a lantern up on their horse, as. does roy, the slave in lead position on the chain gang. its also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves, two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. in fact the seven chained together slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison, resemble a human locomotive. the slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both speck brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white fur collars. when... .a sound and a small light appears ahead of them on the road. this makes the slave traders stop their human live stock, and ready their rifles for possible trouble. 3 a black horse carrying a dressed in grey rider, clipclops from the background to the foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the rider carries. the rider appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. a long grey wintercoat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler hat on his head. dicky speck whos that stumblin around in the dark state your business, or prepare to get winged the rider calm yourselves gentlemen, i mean you no harm. im simply a fellow weary traveler. the rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two slavers, and their slaves, lifting the lantern up to his face. he speaks with a slight german accent. the rider to the slavers good cold evening gentlemen. to the shivering slaves good eveningim looking for a pair of slave traders that go by thename of the speck brothers. might that be you ace speck who wants to. know the rider i do. im dr. king schultz, and this is my horse, fritz. fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught him. dicky speck you a doctor dr.schultz affirmative. dicky speck what kinda doctor dr.schultz dentist. are you the speck brothers, and did you purchase those men at the greenville.slave auction ace speck so what le dr.schultz so, i wish to parley with you. ace speck speak english dr.schultz oh, im sorry. please forgive me, it is a second language. amongst your inventory, ive been led to believe, is a specimen im keen to acquire. to the slaves hello you poor devils. is there one among you, who was formerly a resident of the carrucan plantation since roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. in the darkness a voice rings out djangos voice os im from the carrucan plantation. dr.schultz moves fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his lantern, illuminating our hero django. dr.schultz splendid and whats your name young, man django django. dr.schultz wunderbar youre exactly the one im looking for. so tell me django  by the way thats a amazing name  during your time at the carrucan plantation, did you come to know three overseers by the name of the brittle brothers django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz is delighted. dr.schultz big john, ellis, and little brother raj django dem da brittle brothers. dr.schultz so django, do you think you could recognize  . the speck brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief. ace speck hey, stop talkin to him like that dr.schultz like what ace spec like that dr.schultz my good man, im simply trying to ascertain ace speck speak english, goddamit dr.schultz everybody calm down im simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction. ace speck i dont care, no sale. now off wit ya dr.schultz dont be ridiculous, of course theyre for sale. ace raises his rifle towards the german. ace speck move it ace cocks back the rifle hammer. dr.schultz my good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention... ace speck last chance, fancy pants dr.schultz  very well  the doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in darkness. the next flash of light we see is the good doctors pistol out of his holster, and firing point blank into ace specks face... .blowing the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt. before dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the germans direction... bam... dr.schultz shoots his horse in the head... .the steed goes down taking dicky with him... when the dead weight horse lands on dickys slightly twisted leg, we hear two distinct cracking sounds... dicky lets out a bitch like scream. the slaves watch all this. theyve never seen a white man kill another white man before. dicky is pinned down under his ole paint. django watches in the dark, the german climb down off his horse, pick up aces discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining speck. dr.schultz sorry about putting a bullet in your beast. but i didnt want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses. dr.sch.ultz lights the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over dickys body. dicky speck you goddamn son of a bitch, you killed ace dr.schultz. i only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me. and i do believe i have ... counting out the slaves .one, two, three, four, five, six, seven witnesses who can attest to that fact. dicky speck my damn legs busted dr.schultz no doubt. now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, id like to finish my line of inquiry with young django. to django as i was saying, if you were to see the brittle brothers again, would you recognize them django yes. dr.schultz now im sure. to you, all unshaven white men look alike. so django, in a crowd of unshaven white men, can you honestly and positively point out the brittle brothers django spaghetti western flashback were in his little shack at the carrucan plantation. its pissing rain outside. django is making love to his wife broomhilda, when she stops letting out a shout. the three overseers known as the brittle brothers are outside peeking in through the window. they burst in through the front door. soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement. as django and broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze her tit. . .they bring a belt across djangos backside to make him fuck faster. . .then they yank him off, as big john climbs on top of broomhilda..the other brittle brothers whip django with their belts, and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife. back to django django i can point em out. dr.schultz sold american so mr.speck, how much for django dicky speck im gonna lose this leg dr.schultz yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, im afraid that will be the. end result. but back to business, how much do you want for django dicky speck you go to hell dr.schultz dont be silly. how much for django dicky speck 800 dollars dr.schultz oh come now, i may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does, but neither was i born yesterday. 8 the. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket. dr.schultz in this most helpful pamphlet that i picked up at the greenville slave auction, it says that the going rate for african flesh  in particularly a field nigger is sixty to eighty dollars. now handsome no doubt as django is, technically, he is a field. nigger. which according tothis pamphlet here  and why would they lie  puts his price at eighty dollars. so in light of that, how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young django here. dr.schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver. dr.schultz and since your late brother. wont be using it anymore, id like to purchase his nag. he removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on dickys body. he bends down and, puts the paper money.in the saddle bags on dickys dead horse. with.his hands in there, he roots around and finds the keys tothe leg irons. he unlocks djangos leg irons. django is free. dr.schultz there you go django,. give your ankles a good rubbing, then get up on that horse. also, if i was you, id take that winter coat the dear departed speck left behind. django removes the coat from the dead slaver. puts on the warm jacket over his bare back, and climbs up on ace specks horse. dr.schultz turns to dicky on the ground. dr.schultz mr.speck, i am afraid i will require a bill of sale. do you have one dicky just curses him. he says, removing a notebook from his pocket dr.schultz i thought not. no worries, i come prepared. as he writes this will serve nicely as a bill of sale. he stops, then says to django django is spelled with a silent d, is it not 9 django huh dr.schultz why not.. he writes it in his book with a silent d, then stops to admire the way it looks. dr.schultz yes, that does add a little character. the german dentist lowers himself by the speck brother pinned down under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen. dr.schultz if youd be so kind speck, as to make your mark here. the. hillbilly spits in the german gentlemans face. the good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief. then takes out a pocket knife. and whispers something that cant be heard in the slavers ear. he signs the bill of sale. dr.schultz mr.speck, i would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you, but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired. the good doctor climbs back up on fritz, and looks to the six slaves, in leg irons. dr.schultz now as to you poor devils. he tosses to pudgy ralph the keys to the shackles. dr.schultz so as i.see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices. one, once im gone, you lift that beast off the remaining speck, then carry him to the nearest town. which would be at least thirtyseven miles back the way you came. or ... .two, you unshackle yourselves, take that rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country. the choice is yours. hes just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds 0 dr.schultz oh, and on the off chance that theres any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the north star is that one. tata. he looks to django, who doesnt know how to start his horse. dr.schultz just give him a little kick. django does, and the horse responds by moving. dr.schultz see, its not so difficult. ext  morning texas landscape  sunrise the dawn breaks on a western landscape. the two men ride their horses silently, horse hooves clipclopping among the rocks. django wears specks winter coat, with one of dr.schultzs white button down dress shirts underneath it. as they ride through the picturesque scene... dr.schultz breaks the silence. dr.schultz so, django, what do you intend to name him django who dr.schultz your horse django what horse dr.schultz the horse youre riding. django this aint my horse. dr.schultz yes it is. django no it aint, its your horse. im just riding it. dr.schultz well, technically, yes  wait a minute  technically not. if its my horse, i can give it to you, and as of now, im doing such. django, youre now the proud owner of a horse, congratulations. 1 django i cant feed no horse. i cant put no horse up in no stable. dr.schultz frustrated dont worry about all that they ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself... then says with a smile dr.schultz so... . now that thats settled... . what do you intend to name it half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name. for instance my steed is named fritz. hes stubborn, ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but i couldnt do without him. he pats fritzs neck anyway, the name of ones steed, isnt something one does lightly. so once youve thought about it for awhile  django  tony. dr.schultz  tony what django  i dunno, tony the horse. dr.schultz oh, you mean you want to name your horse tony django yeah. thats what you jus asked me, right dr.schultz when youre right youre right, indeed i did. why tony django i gotta tell ya you didnt tell me i gotta tell ya. as they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a western town. they pass by a sign that says welcome to daughtrey, texas z dr.schultz well im naturally curious, of course, but theres no reason you must tell me. in fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed. and i do believe tony wears it well. good job django, well done. ext  the western town of daughtrey  morning as the citizens of daughtrey wake up, django and dr.schultz ride fritz and tony through the main street of town..daughtrey looks like a million western towns weve seen before in movies. but to the townspeople of daughtrey, django and the german dont look like a million other visitors. dr.schultz whats everybody staring at django they never seen a nigger on a horse before. dr.schultz whats this bizarre obsession they have with. you not riding horses django you askin me dr.schultz stops fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. django has a little trouble both stopping tony and getting off him, but it gets done. dr.schultz keeps bombarding the slave with questions. dr.schultz so what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in as per usual with this white man, django thinks what dr.schultz im just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you cant do, and if you cant do it, why cant you do it like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it would the authorities frown on that django hell yeah, they gonna frown. dr.schultz what part would they find the most offensive 13 django all of it. i cant be walkin in no saloon. i cant be sittin my ass on no chair, at no table. i cant be drinkin no drink. and i definitely cant be sharin no drink, with no white man, in public. dr.schultz so if you and i did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff django you bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff. the good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance. dr.schultz well in that case django, after you. django whoa  i aint funnin, i cant go in there. dr.schultz django youre going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said theres no time like the,present. he takes django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment. int  saloon  morning the nervous black slave and the confident germandentist walk into the saloon. the saloon keeper pete is high up on a chair placed high up on a table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. his back is turned away from the two patrons. dr.schultz good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers. saloon keeper it,s still pretty early, we wont be open for about a hour. but by then well be servin breakfast  he turns around and sees them. saloon keeper whoa what the hell you think you doin boy, get that nigger outta here. it time cut ext  saloon  morning its about five minutes later, and the saloon keeper comes running out of the bar to get the sheriff. when dr.schultz, sitting at a table with the young django, calls dr.schultz inn keeper remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall. this wouldnt be the marshalls jurisdiction.this is just a infraction, on what i assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the sheriff. the saloon keeper runs away. the two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon. dr.schultz it looks like we must act as our own bartender. the german stands up, and walksbehind the bar, and pours two beers from the tap into mugs. django remains seated, and after a beat, asks django what kinda dentist are you this makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beers. dr.schultz i havent practiced dentistry in five years  not to say once i know you better, i wouldnt like to get a look at that mouth  im sure its a disaster  but these days i practice a new profession ... . bounty hunter. this gets no reaction from django. dr.schultz do you know what a bounty hunter is the black man shakes his head, no. as the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer, he explains dr.schultz well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses. 15 dr.schultz contd the state places a bounty on a mans head. i track that man, i find that man, i kill that man. after ive killed him, i transport that mans corpse back to the authorities  and sometimes thats easier said then done. i show that corpse to the authorities  proving, yes indeed, i have truly killed him  at which point, the authorities pay me the bounty. lifting his beer cheers. the two men touch glasses, and take a drink. django whats a bounty dr.schultz its like a reward. django you kill people and they give you a reward dr.schultz certain people, yes. django white people dr.schultz mostly. a few mexicans. couple chinamen. django bad people dr.schultz badder they are, bigger the reward. which brings me to you, and i must admit im at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you. on one hand, i despise slavery. on the other hand, i need your help, and if youre not in a position to refuse, all the better. so for the time being, im going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit. beat still... . having said that, .i feel guilty. so... id like the two of us to enter into an agreement. im looking for the brittle brothers, however in this endeavor im at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, i dont know what they look like. but you do... .dontcha 1g . django spaghetti western flashback django, back at the carrucan plantation, held down by roger and ellis brittle, as big john burns the r into his cheek with a branding iron. back to django django i know what they look like, all right. dr.schultz good. so, heres my agreement. you travel with me till we find them  django  where we goin dr.schultz i hear at least two of them are overseeing up in gatlinburg, but i dont know where. that means we visit every plantation in gatlinburg till we find them. and when we find them, you point them out, and i kill them. you do that, i agree to give you your freedom... . twentyfive dollars per brittle brother  thats seventyfive dollars... . your horse, tony even though ive already gave him to you  but once the final brittle brother lies dead in the dust, ill buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included. dr.schultzs eyes go to the saloon window. dr.schultz and as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff. ext  saloon  morning we see the sheriff, bill sharp, walk towards the saloon cradling a winchester. some townspeople like the saloon keeper stand around to watch. a. young boy leads a herd of baby goats through town. sheriff sharp stands in the middle of the street. sheriff sharp okay boys, funs over, come on out. both the doctor and django stand up and walk to the front porch. as they do, the sheriff says 1 2 sheriff sharp now why yall wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people you aint got nothin better to do, then to come into bill sharps town and show your ass  from his top step on the porch, dr. king schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... . .then... a small derringer  pops into schultzs hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. once in hand, the dentist fires one tiny bullet into the belly of bill sharp. the tiny gun makes a tiny pop sound. the shocked bill sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the dirt. the townspeople are startled. as is django. as schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading his tiny pop shooter, a pedestrian yells out pedestrian what did you jus do to our sheriff dr.schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law mans skull, killing him dead. in the background, one woman faints. the boy and his goats scatter. dr.schultz looks over at the saloon keeper, across the street. dr.schultz now you can go get the marshall. time cut ext  daughtrey main street  day u.s.marshall gill tatum snaps the menfolk of daughtrey to attention. marshall tatum move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon. and i want six men and six winchesters behind it. and i want two men with two rifles on this roof, and two men with two rifles on that roof, with all barrels pointed at that front door. and somebody git poor bill outta the goddamn street. lp cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon. the marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place. the last sniper on the rooftop takes his position. when... coming from the saloon... . piano music ... int  saloon  day dr.schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number. he seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player. a terrified django, whos sure his new master is a lunatic whos going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains on the window. dr.schultzs suit coat sits draped over a chair. all of his weapons, including his metal sliding rail derringer contraption, lie on a table. he plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest. dr.schultz what are they doing django i think they wonderin why you playin the piana. dr.schultz good. pause but what are they doing django a buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front, now they hidin behind it with guns. and a buncha other white folks are up on the roof, with rifles pointed down here. dr.schultz damn, they got that organized fast. is the marshall out there django if the one i think is the.marshall is the marshall, hes out there. 9 dr.schultz what makes you think hes the marshall django cause hes the one ready to say somethin. marshalls voice you in the saloon dr.schultz stops playing the piano. marshalls voice we got eleven winchesters on every way outta that buildin you got once chance git outta this alive you and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and i mean, right now dr.schultz first things first is this the marshall i have the pleasure of addressing marshall tatum yes it is, this is u.s. marshall gill tatum. dr.schultz wunderbar so marshall, i have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, im ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head. i trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the united states of america, i shant be shot down in the street, by either you or your deputies, before ive had my day in court. marshall tatum you mean like you did our sheriff shot em down like a dog in the street dr.schultz yes, thats exactly what i mean do i have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street marshall tatum well, as much as wed all enjoy seein somethin like that, aint nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town dr.schultz fair enough marshall, here we.come. dr.schultz to django theyre a little tense out there. so dont make any quick movements, and let me do the talking. django looks at him like, as if... ext  saloonmain street  day a lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon. outside of range, the whole town watches the stand off. the saloon doors open, and dr.schultz and django, hands raised, step outside. marshall tatum you unarmed dr.schultz yes indeed we are. marshall tatum, may i address you, your deputies, and apparently the entire town of daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred marshall tatum go on dr.schultz my name is dr.king schultz. and like yourself, marshall, i am a servant of the court. the man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of bill sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of willard peck, with a price on his head of two hundred dollars. thats two hundred dollars, dead or alive. marshall tatum the hell you say dr.schultz i.m aware this is probably disconcerting news. but im willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years. i know this because. three years ago he was rustling cattle from, the b.c. corrigan cattle company of lubbock texas. z dr.schultz contd in my possession. is a warrant made out by circuit court judge henry allen laudermilk of austin texas. you are encouraged to wire him. he will back up who i am, and who your dear departed sheriff was. the menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. then dr.schultz delivers the coup de grace. dr.schultz in other words marshall, you owe me two hundred dollars. cut to ext  tennessee country road  day django and dr.schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles together, ride their horses in the tennessee countryside, on the way to gatlinburg. dr.schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey business suits, and django is still dressed in his slave pants, schultzs button down dress shirt, and ace specks winter coat. somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared onhis feet. dr.schultz one needs a plan, son. these are brutal times. a man who survives, is a man with a plan. a man who thrives, is a man with a good plan. so, having said that, whats your plan, young django django whatcha mean dr.schultz well, after this brittle business is behind us, youll be a free man, with a horse, and seventy five dollars in your back pocket. whats your plan after that django find my wife, and buy her freedom. dr.schultz django, i had no idea you were a married man. do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously django huh zz dr.schultz do slaves believe in marriage django me and my wife do. dr.schultz where is she now django i dunno. they put us in different boxcars, and sent u.s to the greenville slave auction. she got sold two days fore me. but i dont know who to. dr.schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky. dr.schultz care for some jerky django sure. dr.schultz rips him off a piece. django chews on it. as he chews, schultz says dr.schultz so your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and purchase her.freedom only you dont know where she is a chewing django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a moment contemplating the dilemma, then pronounces dr.schultz well that shouldnt be all that difficult. so how long ago did all this happen django a few months ago. dr.schultz three or four django three. dr.schultz so shecamefrom the carrucan plantation, and shewassold at the greenville slave auctiontosome unknown customer three monthsago django nods his head, yes. z3 dr.schultz the bad part about slavery being a business, is its immoral. the good part about it being a business is, they keep records. somewhere in greenville theres a book with your wifes name in it, and the name of the customer who bought her, and more then likely their address. but then schultz seems to get second thoughts. dr.schultz still, seventyfive dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but its not going to get you very far in greenville. not to mention a slave auction town in mississippi isnt the safest place you could visit. free or not. django ill have my freedom papers. dr.schultz yes you will. but say you show them to some rascals, and they take them from you and tear them up django they could do that dr.schultz im not saying they would, but they could. django they do that ill kill em. dr.schultz great now you get hung for killin a white man. the point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you. django well i gotta go, when do i go dr.schultz when you get more dangerous. ext  chattanooga  day muddy and wet big city chattanooga. were in the back of a store that. sells servanthouse nigger uniforms. django comes bursting out of the stores back door. hes very distressed. one glance at the outfit hes wearing explains the distress. z django is dressed in a powder blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit, that wouldnt be out of place in the court of marie antoinette at versailles. dr.schultz comes trailing after him. dr.schultz django, you have to, its part of the act. youre playing a character. your character is the valet. this is what the valet wears. remember what i told you. during the act, you can never break character. cut to ext  bennett manor day we see dr. schultz, riding slightly in front of django, dressed in his blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of bennett manor, a plantation in gatlinburg, tennessee. django leads a riderless horse, behind him and tony. as the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of bennett manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the slaves stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight. the patriarch of bennett manor, spencer big daddy bennett, dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground. while there are plenty black males out in the cotton fields, the majority of the slave population of bennett manor is pretty.black females, fourteen to twentyfour, referred to as, ponys. the biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton. as dr.schultz and fancy pants django, bring fritz and tony to a stop in front of bennett manor, theyve drawn quite a crowd of slaves, bennett family members, and white workers overseers. spencer bennett keeps on the top step so he wont be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse. spencer bennett its against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory. dr.schultz this is my valet, and my valet doesnt walk. spencer bennett i said niggers  z .ate dr.schultz his name is django, hes a free man, and he can ride what he pleases. spencer bennett not on my.property, around my niggers he cant. dr.schultz my good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot. allow me to unring this bell. my name is dr.king schultz, this is my valet, django, and these are our horses, fritz, and tony. fritz, does his head bow. this makes the pretty ponys surrounding bennett, giggle. dr.schultz mr. bennett, ive been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man. and it is in these capacities that weve ridden from texas to tennessee to talk with you now. spencer bennett state your business. dr.schultz i wish to purchase one of your nigger gals. spencer bennett you and your jimmie rode from texas to tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals, no appointment, no nuttin dr.schultz im afraid so. spencer bennett well what if i say, i dont like you, or your fancy pants. nigger, and i wouldnt sell you a tinkers damn  whatcha gotta say about that dr.schultz mr. bennett, if you are the business man, ive been led to believe you to be, i have five thousand things i might say, that could change your mind. i this gets everybodys attention, not least of all spencer bennett. spencer laughs. zg spencer bennett cmon inside, get yourself something cool to drink. the incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does django. then the good doctor walks up the steps to bennett manor. dr.schultz maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort django here around your magnificent grounds. spencer absolutely. betina a pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twentytwo year old slave gal named betina, snaps to attention. betina yes sir, big daddy spencer to schultz whats your jimmies name again dr.schultz django. spencer betina sugar, take django around the grounds. show em all the pretty stuff. betina as you please, big daddy. dr.schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner dr.schultz mr. bennett, i must remind, you, django is a free man. he cannot be treated like a slave. within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself. spencer understood., schultz. betina betina yes, sir spencer django isnt a slave. django is a free man. do you understand youre not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he aint like any of these other niggers around here. ya got it betina ya want i should treat em like white folks spencer no thats not

disapprovingly up and down. betina whatcha do for your massa django didnt you hear him tell ya, i aint no slave. betina so you really free django yes. zy betina you mean you wanna dress like that django fumes. ext  bennett manor back porch  day both spencer bennett and dr.schultz sit on the back porch drinking lemonade. dr.schultz ive beentold by those who should know, the most exquisite african flesh in the state of tennessee is bred right here on your land. and from the look of these black angels, my sources werent wrong. spencer oh i got my share of, coal blacks, horse faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the field. but the lion share of my lady niggers are real show ponys. dr.schultz well thats what im looking for, a show pony for young django. so the only question that remains is, do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars spencer dr.schultz, five thousand dollar nigger, is practically my middle name. back to django and betina betina and django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds. the cotton fields and the slaves picking it, in the background. django betina, come over here, i need to ask you something. he moves her by the tree for more privacy. betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all loveydovey, and she couldnt be less interested. betina whatcho want django im lookin for three white men. three brothers. overseers. their name

of em out to me betina well ones over in that field. she points to the cotton field, at a overseer on top of a horse, whip in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy. django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and takes out a shiny brass spyglass, the type a sea captain might use. obviously a prop from dr.schultz. he slides it open, places it against his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton field landscape. spyglass pov astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself shaffer, but who django knows to be ellis brittle, looks on, oblivious to djangos observation. django spaghetti western flashback he remembers ellis brittle burning a r into broomhildas cheek with a branding iron. back to django and the spyglass he lowers the glass. 3 0 betina innocently is that who you lookin for django yep. he folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse. django wheres the other two betina. they by the stable, punishin

keep goin that way. which means go to the shed and turn right. django go git that white man, i came here with. he slaps her ass, to hurry her up. then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him and the brittle brothers. flash on a memory from the carrucan plantation the brittle brothers giving his wife broomhilda, a peelin. peelin  a punishment by bullwhip, across the back. little raj makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot. making django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped. big john brittle slashes the beauty of broomhildas back with

youd break everything in goddamn sight, you werent cured. and the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin. little jody begs to differ. back to django as django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to little jody and the brittle brothers, he collects eight little friends who happily run along with the fast walking man. eight little french bulldogs who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. django pays the little dogs no nevermind. 3 2 back to big john brittle in position to take the skin off of little jodys back. big john after this well see if you break eggs

little lord flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little french bulldogs. little jody on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up sees the same thing in the mirror. little raj looks to his left at the sounds of the voice. big john turns toward django, who he still doesnt recognize. django just stares back. big john smile disappears. he recognizes django. so does roger. little raj django django crosses toward big john, raising up his arm like hes going to shake his hand ... django remember me .django extends his arm, and dr.schultzs derringer arm contraption,. pops the tiny gun into his hand, and he fires a tiny bullet smack dab into big johns merciless heart. big john face goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his heart, at django. django i like the way you die, boy. 3 3 big john hears it...then tips over dead. little jody cant believe what shes just seen. four other slaves who just happen to be walking in the background, see it. little raj is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip, but since hes no gunman, in his haste, he gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground. it goes off... bang. shooting himself in the foot, he hops up and down in pain. the bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the bang. django picks big johns whip off the ground., and begins whipping little raj across the face and chest. more slaves gather. django whips him to the ground whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks rogers pistol off the ground, and empties it five shots into roger. to say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement. dr.schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. he sees django, and the two dead bodies. dr.schultz who are they django thats john brittle, and thats his little brother raj. dr.schultz wheres ellis django hes the one hightailin it across that field right now. ellis brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field

blood splashes on white cotton. the german and django have the entire plantations attention. spencer bennett with his winchester, his sons and his overseers, and some house niggers come around like a angry mob. the german tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands. django does the same with his pistol. dr.schultz addresses the angry mob. dr.schultz everybody calm down, we mean no one else

brittle, and roger brittle  django  they were goin by the name, shaffer. dr.schultz you know them by the name, shaffer. but the butchers real nameswere brittle. these are wanted men. the law wants them for murder. i reiterate, this warrant states dead or alive. when django and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal. boundaries. now i realize passions are high. but i must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is, you will be hung by the neck until you are dead. this does put a momentary pause in the lynch mobs blood lust. after his dramatic pause for effect... .dr.schultz says dr.schultz may i please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it resting his winchester over his shoulder, bennett reaches for the paper. spencer gimmie. dr.schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to the plantation owner. bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to what it says. dr.schultz satisfied. bennett eyes go from the warrant to the german. dr.schultz may i have that back 36 , bennett hands schultz back the piece of paper. dr.schultz we good bennett

bounty hunters brought with them. both bounty hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave. with all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man start to ride out, when spencer big daddy bennett, steps in their way for one final threat. bennett aint nobody gonna touch you and your jimmie while you on my property. but for lettin a nigger kill a white man, and especially for letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers, yall aint gonna make it out of the county alive. mark my words schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin from my motherfuckin gate. dr.schultz im fully aware bennett, that you and your regulator playmates arent shy about killing for what you believe in. but mark my words big daddy, if you make a

broomhildas first masters were german dr.schultz broomhilda is a german name. if they named her, it stands to reason theyd be german. django lotsa gals where you from named broomhilda dr.schultz no, not so much. broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the german legends. django really theres a story bout broomhilda dr.schultz yes there is. django do you know it dr.schultz every german knows that story. would you like me to tell you django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz well broomhilda was a princess. she was the daughter of wotan, the god of all gods. anyway, her father is really mad at her. django what she do. dr.schultz i dont exactly remember. i think she disobeys him in some way. so at first hes just going to obliterate her  django obliterate... . what does that mean dr.schultz like blow up. he pantomimes a explosion. django phew, thats pretty mad. dr.schultz yes it is, and like most fathers, given a little time, he calms down a bit. hes still mad at her. he still wants to punish her. just not ... . blow her up. so instead what he does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain. django broomhildas on a mountain dr.schultz its a german legend, theres always going to be a mountain in there somewhere. so, he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain. and. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire. and there broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her. django does a fella arise from now on as dr.schultz talks, hes beginning to realize something he wasnt aware of when the conversation started. dr.schultz yes django, as a matter he does. a fella named, sigfried. django does sigfried save her dr.schultz yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so. now true, he is assisted in his triumph by a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having said that, sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to his courage. he scales the mountain, because hes not afraid of it. he defeats the dragon, because hes not afraid.of him. dr.schultz cont he walks through hellfire because broomhildas worth. it. after that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches. django i know how he feels. dr.schultz i think im just starting to realize that. he pours django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he thinks about what hes going to say next. dr.schultz look django, i dont doubt one day you will save your lady love. but im afraid i cant let you go to greenville in a good conscious. let me ask you a question, how do you like the bounty hunting business django kill white folks, and they pay ya whats not to like dr.schultz i hafta admit, we make a good team. django but ithought you were mad at me for killin big john and rodger dr.schultz yes, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous. but normally, thats a good thing. howd you like to partner up for the winter django whatd ya mean partner up dr.schultz you be my deputy, for real this time. a lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs. some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece. with one man, anything over three men is a risk. but with a partner creating cross fire its fish in a. barrel. a lot of these gangs hold up in thehills for the winter. django you makin another agreement w7 dr.schultz yes. you work with me through the winter, till the snow melts. i give you a third of my bounties. and while were together, ill teach you a few things youre going to need to know. django can you teach me how to make tony do that head bow thing that fritz can do dr.schultz that among other things. we make some money this winter, when the snow melts, ill take you to greenville myself, and well find where they sent your wife. im pretty good at finding people. is it a deal no white man has ever done anything for django, just to him. so understandably, hes a little suspicious. django why you care what happens to me why you care if i find my wife dr.schultz well frankly, ive never given anybody their freedom before. and now that i have, i feel vaguely responsible for you. youre just not ready to go off on your own, its that simple. youre too green, youll get hurt. plus when a german meets a real life sigfried,. its kind of a big deal. as a german, im obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved broomhilda. django accepts that response. what follows is a montage covering the five months that django and schultz partner up as bounty hunters. schultz wears his normal ensemble. django wears his cool looking green jacket, unless its really cold, which a lot of this montage is. then he still wears ace specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes. we see a scene to be improvised more or less, where dr.schultz teaches django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip. by the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see djangos going to be good at this. ext  hillside  sunny day we see django and dr.schultz walking up a hill. tony and fritz have been left tied up downhill. django leads a extra body horse named poncho behind him. dr.schultz carries his scope sight rifle in a long case. they get to the top of the hill. it overlooks a small farmhouse. y, 8 down below we see a little man struggling behind a plow, and his fifteen year old son helping him by leading the horse forward. on top of their perch on the hill top, dr.schultz says dr.schultz keep down or hell see you. django who that farmer who cares dr.schultz well since we came here to kill em, he just might. django what the little man pushin that plow dr.schultz that little man pushing that plow, is smitty bacall. django smitty bacall is a farmer dr.schultz no. smitty bacall is a stagecoach robber whos hiding out as a farmer, because theres a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head. he hands django the scope rifle case. dr.schultz and hes all yours my boy. django lays on his belly, with the scope sight up to his eye. scope sight pov on the farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse and his son. djangos finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates. dr.schultz oh what happened.to mister i wanna kill white folks for money django his sons with him. dr.schultz good. hell have a loved one with him. maybe even share a last word. thats better then most get, and a damn. sight better then he deserves. 19 django still hesitates. dr.schultz put down the rifle. dont worry, im not mad at you. take out smitty bacalls handbill. django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants. dr.schultz read it aloud. consider it todays lesson. django reading wanted, dead or alive. smitty bacall and the smitty bacall gang. for murder and stagecoach robbery. seven thousand dollars for smitty bacall. one thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members. known members of the smitty bacall gang are as follows, dandy michaels, gerald nash, and crazy craig koons. dr.schultz well done. bravo. that is who smitty bacall is. if smitty bacall wanted to start a farm at twentytwo, they would never of printed that. referring to the handbill but smitty bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didnt mind killing people to do it. you want to save your wife by doing what i do this is what i do. i kill people, and sell their corpses for cash. his corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him. django shoots. the little man down below behind the plow falls down. the young boy doesnt know what happened at first. then he figuresout his father was just shot. he goes to him in the dirt. dr.schultz you need to keep that smitty bacall handbill. django why dr.schultz its good luck. you always keep the handbill of your first bounty. they begin walking down the hill, to collect smitty bacalls body, leading the extra body horse behind them. 50 as they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of smitty bacalls son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies. dr.schultz see, theyre having a tender little father son moment now. no doubt the most heartfelt one theyve ever had. ext  snowy forest  night its now full on snowy winter in the hills. django practices his quick draw against a snowman hes built. he sticks a bottle in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowmans heart would be. he draws... shoots the bottle heart he draws ... shoots the left coal eye. he draws ... shoots the right coal eye. he draws... shoots the carrot nose. dr.schultz comes up behind him. dr.schultz i think its safe to say youre faster then the snowman. ext  snowy forest  different night a outlaw gang known as the wilson  lowe gang five guys ride through a snowy forest at night. when all five men and their horses, are shot from above. django and schultz up in a tree, firing down on them. ext  winter mountain town main street  night the flakes continue to fall hard as dr.schultz and django ride down the main street of town, pulling poor poncho whos fully loaded down with five corpses. 571 the local sheriff, don gus, watches the two men ride up, he knows them. sheriff gus doctor and django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there dr.schultz the wilson  lowe gang. sheriff gus who the hells the wilson  lowe gang dr.schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands it down to the friendly peace officer. dr.schultz bad chuck wilson, and meaner bobby lowe. and three of their acolytes. sheriff gus just leave em out here, they aint going nowhere. and ifin they do, god must love em, so who are we to say. come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee. tnt  sheriff guss office  night the snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office. they exchange pleasantries about the weather as the sheriff pours them coffee. after the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid, they get down to business. as schultz and gus discuss the bounties, django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. on the third one he reads, warren vanders, and a two thousand dollar bounty, that one, schultz says. django rips it off the wall. as the winter has progressed, we see theyve become a genuine bounty hunting team. and django, a genuine bounty hunter. ext  pretty meadow  day the snow has melted, and its spring. and inside of this meadow django practices his fast draw against five men... .by schultz throwing five coins in the air ... django draws fast shoots three coins, fires again hitting another, then falls to the ground to get the fifth. he looks up from the ground at schultz. 5l as schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says dr.schultz youre pretty confident arent you django nods his head, yes. dr.schultz you have reason to be. he holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm. all the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. he drops them on top of django. django still think im too green for greenville dr.schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says dr.schultz oh youre ready for greenville. he lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says dr.schultz greenville ready for you, that im not so sure. he blows out the match... we go to black what we also saw in the above montage is django shake off a lifetime of slavery. django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his steed tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man. hes not a slave anymore. hes a bounty hunter. black title card across the screen one letter at a time style ala rocky and flashdance mississippi cut to ext  the town of greenville mississippi  day the whole main street of greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other. 53 we see django and dr.schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in the mud,, down the main street of greenville mississippi. the buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around. black men, women, and children in bondage are everywhere you look. lines of chained slaves being marched one way or the other, move through the muddy streets of greenville. white men on horses move them along. buckboards filled with domestic slaves house niggers, and pretty ponys, driven by white men roll through the street. a young white boy 14 years old, a shepherd, leads a bunch of slave children through town. a shepherds dog, helps him out by moving the kids along. impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block. a subtitle appears on the bottom of the screen greenville chickasaw county, mississippi dr.schultz takes in this african flesh market, where human beings sell other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock. django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how greenville operates. as he rides tony through town in his snappy duds, he looksat the black men half dressed in chains. he remembers himself with his six other companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of main street by the speck brothers. on that day he might as well of been a steer. today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy outfit, astride his steed tony, he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill. django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge slave pen, like a steer corral. at the moment theres no train in the depot. we flash on the train, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot. inside one of the boxcars amidst a boxcar full of shirtless black males, django watches the train pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar. a hatch in the roof of the boxcar is noisily yanked open, and two white slave traders russ and judd, peer down at their human cargo. judd good god almighty these niggers stink i f russ niggers stink, wheres the shock to the slaves below okay you bucks, listen up, and listen well, im only gonna say this once. theres a slave corral right across from this boxcar. we gittin ready to open these doors. when we do, yall run as fast as you can, right into that pen. anyone gittin off trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. now you niggers better comprehend. and that goes for any african garboons amongst yall cant understand english ... . your american buddies better shove your ass in the right direction, or your trip to this country is going to be short, and pointless. train to pen as fast as you can the boxcar door is slid open, and a hundred and fifty black males run full out from the train to the steer corral. we spot django during the running. once inside the corral, the gate is closed. cowboys with rifles act as prison guards. inside the corral through the wooden posts, in the distance, django watches them open up the boxcar holding the females. they do their run to their pen out of view. django catches a quick glimpse of broomhild.a running with the other ladies, then shes gone from view. back to django present django and dr.schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of greenville. dr.schultz its a spectacle out of dante. django you should see it from the other side. dr.schultz frankly, i dont know if i could endure this. django youd be surprised what you can endure. beat where to 675 dr.schultz records office. cut to int  records office  day dr.schultz and django walk into a records office, lined with books. we watch through the store front window, the black man and white man enter, and dr.schultz present his business card to a dickensian looking records office worker. as schultz starts his spellbinding with words routine... . the camera fades to black. black title card broomhilda int  slave pen  day the same shot we saw before of django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen, to get a better last look of broomhilda. broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance. then, as before django loses sight of her. ext  main street  greenville  day we follow in front of broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by two white male slavers. her bare feet slosh in the main street mud, and the leg irons scrap her ankles. up until now everything youve ever seen of broomhilda, has only been in djangos spaghetti western flashbacks. in other words, from his perspective, and memory. this is the,only time the story will shift to broomhildas perspective. the strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of main street. broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that django was sold in at the beginning. instead shes just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon. her seller clyde starts his pitch on the twelve or so buyers that watch this puny make shift auction. broomhilda looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her breath which one will buy her. among the ugly white men we see mr.harmony mike, not quite as ugly as the rest. an older well dressed, classy gentleman. next to him is his twenty four year old overweight awkward son scotty harmony. scotty in the audience, and broomhilda on the wagon, their eyes meet, he nudges his dad. the seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. then her back, revealing her whip marks. then pointing out the runaway r branded in her cheek. some of the crowd, including scotty, react with repulsion at the sight of the whip marks. the seller assures the crowd, that niggers dont feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle. seller  clyde fellahs, you aint felt gentle, till you felt nigger gal gentle. ugly man makes a bid. broomhilda yikes. uglier man higher bid. broomhilda reacts. uglier by far guy makes leap frog big bid. broomhilda reacts. big greasy fat guy makes a bid. big fat greasy beaver pelt covered trapper makes a bid. a giggling leering group of brothers make a bid. a seventy five year old indian on a mule makes a bid. mr.harmony makes a bid for his son scotty. broomhilda notices that. and makes more eye contact with scotty. they look at each other as mr.harmony continues to bid. a literary narrator comes on the soundtrack. narrator vo on that day, eight months ago, the auction was won by mike harmony, as a birthday present for his fat boy son scotty. mr.harmony congratulates his son. from on top of the buckboard broomhilda looks down at her new owners. later they leave for the harmony house. scotty lifts broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard. he hands her a little white bag. scotty this is for you. she opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it. scotty theyre jelly beans. try one. she selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth. scotty good huh she nods her head, yes. we see him drive the buckboard out of greenville with broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans. xt  country road  day the buckboard makes its way down a country road. broomhilda in the back, and scotty driving the wagon. scotty bought her, but hes too scared to talk to her. broomhildas muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. shes beginning to realize the young master is the shy type. broomhilda master scotty...  scotty yes broomhilda broomhilda im lonely back here. can i come on up with you on that seat so we can talk scotty please, id love that. she climbs into the drivers seat. in more ways then one. 8 ext  the harmony house  day a nice two story southern house. very nice, but hardly a plantation. the households four domestic slaves. broomhilda will be the fifth. the buckboard pulls up to the front of the house. scottys mother, mrs.harmony mary louise, waits to meet her son, and his new bought nigger gal. the older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her mrs.harmony whats your name, gal broomhilda broomhilda. mrs.harmony follow me. into the kitchen, to her son you stay out here. int  kitchen  day mrs.harmony brings broomhilda in her kitchen. the two domestic slaves that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. mrs.harmony grabs broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her mrs.harmony i want to have a word with you, wench. you met my boy scotty. you can tell aint no white girl gonna fool with him. and if they do fool with him, they fool with him for the wrong reason. boys twenty four, he still aint a man yet. thats why youre here. be nice to him. hes a very sweet boy. play him right, hell eat bird seed out of your palm. play em wrong, youll deal with me. broomhilda i like scotty. hes just shy is all. all he needs is a little confidence. mrs.harmony and youll give that to him broomhilda ill do my best, mam. scottys a real sweet boy. mrs.harmony he is, isnt he broomhilda ahhuh. the mother lets go of the young ladys wrist. 19 narrator vo basically the harmonys bought a slave bride for young master scotty that day. and the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile. we see scotty and broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime.. at night they catch lightning bugs together. at night in scottys bed, while the young man lay fast asleep, broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of glowing lightning bugs. narrator vo as scottys sort of defacto sweetheart, if no visitors were about, broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table. we see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. narrator.vo and pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family. mrs.harmony and broomhilda sewing together. the harmony family and broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard. after dinner, mrs.harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano. mr.harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook. narrator vo scotty was never happier. scotty and broomhilda walking holding hands at southern magic hour. broomhilda having sex with scotty, baby talking with him, talking him through it, making him feel loved and secure. narrator vo after three months of this bliss, scotty decided to take broomhilda for a romantic weekend in greenville. scotty and broomhilda drive through the main street of greenville, dressed to the nines, in a fancy carriage. broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress, complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol. scotty, very proud of his pretty pony, is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy. 6o narrator vo white masters would take their pretty ponys to greenville for a treat or romantic excursion, for two reasonsone, seeing how bad the other slaves had it, always made the papered ponys appreciate their privilege position, just in case theyd forgot. broomhilda holding her parasol, looking like a black daisy miller, watches the other slaves march by in the mud. they watch her too. int  hotel lobby  night broomhilda and scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel lobby, and rent a room at the front desk. insert hotel registry scotty signs his name. the desk clerks hand checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion. int . greenville  night greenville at night is a little different. at night, rich white masters showing off their ponys like scotty, rule the streets. narrator vo and two, there was a sliver of society that ran through greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to as, nigger love. at night the streets, the bars, bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty ponys. ext  cleopatra club  night an establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into private club called, the cleopatra club. narrator vo but the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity, was the members only, cleopatra club. insert gold plaque with the name, the cleopatra club on it, next to it is a profile of nefertiti. 6 int  the cleopatra club  restaurant  night the interracial joint is jumping as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women. scotty and broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room. we see across the dining room, the powerful white man, calvin candie, sitting with some white men and some black ponys, eyeing broomhilda. scotty i gotta tell you broomhilda  i dont care if i go to. hell for this  i love you. and if loving you means i go to hell ... . well then hello mr.devil. that was actually kind of funny. broomhilda was right, all he needed was a little confidence. she puts her hand on his. narrator vo then... speak of the devil and the devil appears. calvin candie appears at their table. calvin candie hello, my name is calvin candie, i own the cleopatra club. and i would just like to welcome an attractive couplelike yourselves to my favorite place on earth. scotty stands up and shakes hands with calvin. scotty thank you so much, its a great honor. we love it here. pointing at a empty chair. calvin candie may i join you scotty please, by all means. calvin sits down. broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack. scotty, as per usual, is clueless. calvin candie how long have you been a member scotty we just joined this weekend. calvin candie well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage. some may consider the dues excessive, but theyre necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle weve all become accustomed to. scotty well said, and money well spent. he squeezes broomhildas hand. candie sees this. calvin candie it would be.my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table. broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided. but scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like calvin candie. she tries to imply they should stay where they are. he brushes her off with a, dont be silly. we see calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they join the party. calvin candie has his arm around a foxy pony named sheba, whose dress is a little more revealing then the others. they drink and talk, and the white men have a forced good time. but calvin candie cant hide his sinister side from broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed. scottys having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to scottys disobedience. if these fancy.fucking white men werent around making scotty feel so puffy chested, hed never dismiss her that way. we follow broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel. narrator vo after excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room. she got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didnt care, the night was ruined anyway. some romantic weekend. wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her. shell fix his fat ass. wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time. shes gonna scrape every pimple. 3 . back at the cleo club the now drunk scotty is playing poker with calvin and his friends. narrator vo back at the cleopatra club, as the night wore on, calvin candie suggesteda friendly card game. as the game wore on, it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between calvin candie and scotty harmony. luckily for him, scotty was holding.a inside straight. calvin holds his cards with sheba draped around him. she whispers something in his ear. candie to sheba really to scotty you know what sheba just tole me scotty, thinking about his great hand, says scotty what candie she says she thinks youre cute. scotty

all to the amusement of the white hotel guests. ext  greenville hotel  night she runs out of the hotel naked, and then trips falling into the greenville mud. she looks up from the mud, at calvin candie looking down at her. calvin candie welcome to candyland. we do a slow zoom into broomhildas face. narrator vo that was four months ago. cut to int  greenville slave auction  day back inside the three story auction block domed room. the same room django was sold in at the beginning. tons of white buyers and sellers and black slaves to be bought or sold fill the big hall. one mandingo slave banjo stands half naked on the auction block. the seller shelby gives the crowd,a sales pitch about banjo, and starts the bidding. many different ugly white men make bids on the big mandingo, including calvin candie. dr.schultz and django from a pair of opera glasses . watch calvin candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing. from dr.schultzs perspective we see calvin candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, bartholomew, always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below. candies lawyer leonide moguy joins him. dr.schultz his name is calvin candle, and he is the owner of candyland. django candyland the mandingo fightin place dr.schultz oh, so you heard of it django aint no slave aint heard of candyland.

the auction hall. dr.schultz how much do you know about mandingo fighting django not so much... a little... master carrucan had a couple niggers hed fight. dr.schultz can you play a mandingo expert django what dr.schultz can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters django why dr.schultz because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if we want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males. so my character is that of a big money buyer from dusseldorf, here in greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game. and your character is the mandingo expert i hired to help me do it. django they call that oneeyed charly. dr.schultz. oneeyed charly django thats what you call it when you buy a slave expert. if you wanna raise horses, but dont know nothin about horses, you buy yourself a oneeyed charly who knows about horses. he teaches ya. you wanna plant tobacco but dont know nothin about it, you buy yourself a oneeyed charly knows about tobacco. dr. schultz why do they call it oneeyed charly 70 django you know,

school together. one could almost say, i was raised to be calvins lawyer. django one could almost say, you a nigger. coco cant believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to mr.moguy. moguy what did you say dr.schultz oh nothing, hes just being cheeky. anything else about mr.candie i should know before i meet him moguy yes, hes a bit of a francophile. 7ef dr.schultz what civilized people arent moguy thats why all the french ambiance. and he prefers monsieur candie to mister candie. dr.schultz says in french subtitled in english dr.schultz french what ever he prefers. this stops moguy, and he turns to warn schultz. moguy oh he doesnt speak french. dont speak french to him, itll embarrass him. they get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room. moguy slides the doors open... the party enters the billiard room. int  billiard room cleopatra club  night inside is calvin candie, his bodyguard bartholomew still dressed in the ill fitting suit, and the lanky sexy sheba. also, at this moment, two mandingos are having a bloody and savage fight to death in this closed room. an older european looking man, whos rooting for the mandingo that calvins not rooting for, is also in the room. his name is.amerigo vassepi. before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, calvin says calvin candie why do you want to get in the mandingo business thats quite abrupt and aggressive. dr.schultz says, as if hes just been massively insulted dr.schultz you dont intend to allow your 2nd... referring to moguy .to make the proper introductions without turning towards them, candie tells schultz 7s calvin candie quit stalling and answer the question. the room is quiet. dr.schultz the awful truth pause im bored, and it seems like a good bit of fun. candie takes that to heart. hell accept it for now. calvin candie well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight goin on thats a good bit of fun dr.schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight. the bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one. schultz has schooled django on the importance of never breaking character. well

seasoned slaver, you are a neophyte. im simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you. dr.schultz with all due respect, monsieur candie, i didnt seek you out for your advice. i sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price. i wasunder the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business. calvin candie no we werent

the eyeballin, you the billfold dr.schultz well you dont make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yes. none of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is. candie turns his attention back to django. calvin candie to django so bright boy,.moguy here tells me you looked over my african flesh, and were none too impressed.

side mississippi  day its the next day and a whole procession is making their way to candyland. calvin candie, leonide moguy, dr.schultz, django, and three overseers billy crash, tommy giles, and hoot peters ride horses. bartholomew now dressed in work clothes drives a buckboard filled withsupplies. five mandingos big fred and banjo who we already met, plus joshua, sidney james, and tatum recently purchased at the greenville auction walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal possessions under their arm. they look like powerful warriors. three other shirtless mandingos rodney, chicken charly, chester who were the mandingos from candyland that didnt sell at greenville are walking back to candyland, with their small bundle of personal possessions under their arms. these poor devils know their fate is pretty dismal. either theyll be sold to the lequint dickey mining company, or theyll be put in some mandingo fight they cant win, like with samson, or stonesiphers dogs. j rodney walks along the road, looks up at django riding his horse. all the slaves hate django because they think hes a black slaver. but the three heading back to candyland are even more resentful. flash on django with schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three. rodney gives django a bad eyeball look up on his horse. django on tony sees it. hes playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he cant let that shit stand. he yells down to the powerless man django gotta problem with your eyeball, boy rodney looks away. rodney no sir. django you want a boot heel in it rodney no sir. django then keep ya damn eyeballs off me flash that bad look at me again, ill give ya reason not to like me as this parade makes progress, django keeps his emotions in check, but not without difficulty. dr.schultz comes riding fritz beside him. dr.schultz how do you like this side of the slave trade django not so much. dr.schultz prefer the other side django i didnt say that. dr.schultz ive confirmed broomhildas at candyland. django are you sure its her dr.schultz he didnt call her by name, but shes a young lady, whip marks on her back, and speaks german. now while its not wise to assume, in this instance, i think its pretty safe. django did you offer to buy her dr.schultz i opened the door to my possible interest. but naturally, sight unseen, i can only be so interested. suddenly ... calvin candie comes riding up behind them... calvin candle am i intruding dr.schultz of course not. calvin candie appraising the two men i swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish. dr.schultz youd be surprised what a good conversationalist django is. calvin candie oh by now, i dont think that would surprise meat all. candie gives django a creepy smile. around now the audience may start noticing dog barking in the distance. dr.schultz when do we reach your property 13 calvin candle you been on it. i own the whole sixty miles fore we get to candyland. candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs. calvin candie excuse me a moment, gentlemen. yelling behind him at billy billy crash, git up here billy crash, a hillbilly overseer whos missing his two front teeth, rides up. billy crash yeah, boss calvin candie find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack billy crash right away, boss. billy crash tears up ahead on his horse. calvin candie you know, confidentially, just tween us girls, worse things about this business, aint the slaves. its all the white trash ya gotta deal with. like these peckawoods we got riding with us. these dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches aint good fer nuttin, except kickin a niggers ass cant kick back. yeah, they holdin the pretty part of the whip, but its just a thin membrane separate em. and dont think they dont know it either. its about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know. but ya need em. who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself. but these mountain boys i use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst. nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies. now like that nigger gal we was talkin bout. im sure it.was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that german lady taught hildi how to speak german. django hears her name himself. his head does involuntary jerk, but his , emotions betray nothing. pte calvin candie cont now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak english. i cant understand a damn word most of em say. you could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork. i tell ya, if it wasnt for catchin a nigger on the run, theyd be as useless as tits on a boar hog. billy crash comes riding back. calvin candie what the hells goin on billy crash they got em a runaway. calvin candie who cut to ext  tracker shack  day a bunkhouse for the four hillbilly trackers they track down runaway slaves that live here about forty miles from the candyland plantation. a little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the bunkhouse. the trackers are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty long haired lot. their leader is mr.,stonesipher, the other three are stew, lex, and jake. the four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons, or just from the same hollow. lex holds two snarling german shepherds on a leash. stew one snarling german shepherd on a leash. and mr.stonesipher holds one snarling german shepherd on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of marsha. a runaway slave named, dartagnan, lies belly down in the dirt, surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who bark, growl, and snap at him. one look at dartagnan tells you hes a mandingo whos been in one fight too many. one of his eyes have been poked out. big bites have been bit out of both his face and neck by past fights, human bites, notthe dogs, as well as three fingers have been bit off. not to mention hes covered in cuts, like hes been drug through a briar patch. o v5 the fourth tracker, jake, doesnt engage in the melodrama. he hangs in the background, cutting firewood with a big axe. calvin candie, dr.schultz, django, and the whole candie caravan look down on the runaway slave. including the five new mandingos, and the three old mandingos who know dartagnan. calvin candie well ill be, dartagnan. now boy, why do a fool thing like run off dartagnan i cant fight no more, monsieur candie. calvin candie oh yes you can. you might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.  mr.stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up, i cant hear myself think mr.stonesipher, yells to marsha mr.stonesipher hush now marsha marsha, hush up marsha, marsha, hush up to the other trackers take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, hes just makin em hungry. the other two yank the dogs away from the fallen black man. calvin candie how long was he loose mr. stonesipher spits tobacco juice. mr.stonesipher a.night. day. half the other night. calvin candie how far he git off property mr.stonesipher bout twenty miles off prop. pretty fer, considering that limp he got. calvin candie moguy, who was dartagnan suppose to fight friday. moguy pointing behind him one of this new lot. calvin candie well the way he looks now a blind indian wouldnt bet a bead on em. to dartagnan boy, you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear. dartagnan starts begging. calvin candie now now, no beggin, no playin on my soft heart. you in trouble now, son. now you need to understand im runnin a business. now i done paid five hundred dollars for you. and when i pay five hundred dollars, i expect to get five fights outta a nigga fore he roll over and play dead. youve fought three fights. dartagnan i won every one. calvin candie well, yes you did. but that last one, you muddied the line between winning and losing. calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway on the ground. calvin candie but the fact remains, i pay five hundred dollars, i want five fights. so what about my five hundred dollars you gonna reimburse me the whites except for schultz laugh. this whole spectacle is making dr.schultz sick to his stomach. not django ... . hes seen this little drama play out many times before. the three returning mandingos, rodney, chicken charly, and chester, watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away. the five new mandingos watch calvin candies treatment of dartagnan to know what to expect from their new home. bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor bastard. calvin prods further. calvin candie you even know what reimburse means e 17 the whites laugh. then suddenly ... .the german speaks dr.schultz ill reimburse you. all eyes turn to dr.schultz. including djangos, whose eyes narrow at the doctor. calvin candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the direction of the good german. calvin candie you will removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket. dr.schultz yes. calvin candie youll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed olejoe, aint fit to push a broom djangos voice cuts through the mississippi heat. django no he wont. all eyes turn to django. django hes just tiredof you toyin with him is all. and for that matter, so am i. but we aint payin a penny for that pickaninny, we aint got no use for em. aint that right, doc dr.schultz realizes hes just done the one thing hes always preached to django you can never do..break character. the doctor puts his billfold back in his suit coat pocket. dr.schultz to candie you heard em. the hillbilly trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the green jacket, slack jawed.  even the one chopping wood in the bg stops his chopping. calvin candie youll hafta excuse mr.stonesiphers slack jawed gaze. he aint never seen a nigger like you ever in his life..aint that right, mr. stonesipher mr.. stonesipher., spits. mr.stonesipher thats right. calvin steps up to django on his horse. looking up at the black man, calvin challenges django to a staring contest. calvin candie well now since you wont pay a penny for this pickaninny, you wont mind me handlin this nigger however i see fit django hes your nigger. calvin candie mr.ston.esipher... .let marsha and her bitches send dartagnan to nigger heaven. mr.stonesipher marsha...git em the other trackers let loose of the leashes holding the german shepherds back. the dogs charge towards dartagnan on his knees... the mandingos all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose. the dogs attack dartagnan ... as we hear the attack ... candie.staring contest with django... django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesnt blink as the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ... the other mandingos are scared sick at what they see. the hillbilly trackers root the dogs on. dr.schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he appears not to enjoy it. calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward dr.schultz, then back . to django. p9 calvin candie your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fightin as dartagnans screams and marshas growls continue off screen. django naw, he just aint use to seein a man ripped apart by dogs, is all. calvin candie but you are use to it django well, him bein german an all, im a little more use to americans then he is. now monsieur candie, whenever youre ready, we rode five hours so you could show off your stock. lets git to it. cause as of now, if hes a example, i aint impressed. calvin...blink... saying nothing, monsieur candie turns his back to django, climbs up on his horse, then looks at the black man. calvin candie follow me. the whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear dartagnan apart. ext  the grounds of candyland  day the caravan starts to approach candyland. calvin candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of mississippi. as the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of slaves picking it. the audience might of been expecting candyland to be a hell on earth, auschwitz, andersonville, yuma prison, a mexican prison in a sergio corbucci spaghetti western ... instead ... . candyland is very beautiful. the fields of cotton, the way the trees hang green vines over everything. its full of nature and natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in. one of the cottonpickers in the field, dobie, looks up, and sees django in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of tony. he taps the shoulder of another cotton picker orwell, and points out django. 90 all of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse. django looks back matching their stare. ext  slave village  day the caravan rolls through the shackcabin village the slaves live in. as the parade rolls through all the slaves snap to attention, and bow very formally as monsieur candie rides past. a king among his subjects, a patron with his peons, a father amongst his children, a shepherd among his sheep. kids playing in the dirt get up and run to calvin on his horse. candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and begins tossing them about. the kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy. this is calvin candie in his element, at his happiest. then ... .django rides by. the caravan moves from the slave village to the white village the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds. other then the switch of white faces for black, its pretty much the same village. and they too see django ... . wow the caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the plantation, or the big house as everyone calls it. to the left of the big house is big wooden arena built for his friday night nigger fights. all the house slaves the domestic slaves that work for the candie family in the big house, and white workers overseers and stray farm hands come out to greet the caravan. they all greet monsieur calvin candie, who naturally leads the procession, as if hes alexander the great returning from the wars. as the caravan comes to a stop in front of the big house, it creates a huge dust cloud behind it. calvins widowed sister lara lee candiefitzwilly, an attractive . fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of the big house to greet her brother. directly above lara lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out. steps... stephen eyeing calvin and the approaching caravan. whos stephen stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate, and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out of dickens  if dickens wrote about house niggers in the antebellum south.  stephen has been calvins slave since he was a little boy. and in almost every way is the 2nd most powerful person at candyland. like the characters basil rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil, scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power for their own self interest. well that describes stephen to a tee. the basil rathbone of house niggers. the old man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach. then... out of the dust cloud ...emerge django and schultz... . on tony and fritz. all the candylanders see django, dressed like he is, up on the horse, and for a moment dont know what to think. lara lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued. as stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket, its hate at first sight. stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a, limp. all the caravan riders are still up on their horses. calvin sees stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do calvin candie hello stephen my boy stephen yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass  whos this nigger up on that nag calvin candie oh stephen, why so ornery, you miss me stephen yeah, i miss you like i miss.a rock in my shoe. like i said, whos this nigger, up on that nag djangos voice

calvin candie that nigger there. let me at least introduce the two of. you. django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, stephen. stephen, this is django. you two should hate each other. stephen usesthe special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at candyland. stephen calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain calvin candie django and his friend

93 stephen pointing at django hes gonna stay in the big house calvin candie stephen, hes a slaver. its different. stephen incredulous in the big house calvin candie you gotta problem with that stephen i dont gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone calvin candie thats my problem, theyre mine to burn. your problem, right now, is making a good impression. and i want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. the old man looks up at his master, and says stephen yes sir, monsieur candie. stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering tohimself. lara lee and her ever present shadow, a fat mammy named cora, comes up to her brother on his horse. calvin candie dr.schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may i present to you, lara lee candiefitzwilly. lara lee does a southern lady bow. dr.schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. dr.schultz i am dr.king schultz, this is my 2nd django, django tips his hat and these are our horses, fritz and tony. both fritz and tony do the head bow. dr.schultz and it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose. lara lee well arent you the charming gentlemen. youre not from around here, are you dr.schultz actually im from a far off land, dusseldorf, to be exact. calvin candie these two are in the market for a fightin nigger. so i thought id invite em down, show em my stock. lara lee well all have dinner tonight, right calvin candie half the reason i invited them. i thought youd find.them as intriguing as i do little sister. lara lee looks up at django, and smiles. all of a sudden three white riders ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones. theolder one is the capt of the overseers, ace woody, and his two assistants brown and jingle bells cody. while ace is dressed for work on a farm, both brown and jingle bells cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits. as calvin candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to dr.schultz and django, and says calvin candie you know since i started fightin niggers about eleven years ago, its been a new lease onlife. and the man ridin up here now is the man responsible for all my success. ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust. through the dust ace, brown, and jingle bells cody eyeball django and schultz. calvin candie howdy ace. to schultz and django this here is my overseer .capt, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, ace woody. 915 pointing at the two shadows that flank ace woody. calvin candie and thats brown and thats jingle bells cody. to ace ace, this here is dr.ring schultz, and django freeman, theyre big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. so i brought em out here so you could give em a little display of our african flesh. ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them. ace woody welcome to candyland, gentlemen. astride their horses brown and jingle bells cody just make faces at django. aces attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from greenville to here. ace woody these the new chickens calvin candie yes siree bob. ace woody how many you get he counts one, two, three, four, five. calvin candie five real strong bucks. ace woody how many you get rid of calvin candie we still got three left. ace looks to see who came back from the auction. leo moguy chimes in moguy i already wired the lequint dickey people, theyll be here tomorrow. ace turns to brown. ace woody get em away from the others. put em in the pen till tomorrow. brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into the slave pen. ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, big fred, banjo, sidney james, tatum,.and joshua. ace woody yall stand over there and make a line they do. ace climbs down from off his horse. cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse. everybody, including django and dr.schultz, watch the show. acewoody walks up and down the line looking at the new men. candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says calvin candie what do

his future moguy i did. ace woody well i dont. ace walks over to the slave in question. ace woody whats your name, boy the mandingo says sidney james sidney james, sir. ace woody so long sidney james. ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and shoots sidney james point blank in the belly. everybody reacts. especially the four other mandingos standing next to him. sidney james rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut. till cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery. moguy, shakes his head, typical, he thinks. django and schultz, on their horses next. to candid, watch. ace looks up at his boss. ace woody boss candie, which one did you buy calvin candie well to me the pick of the litter is big fred over there. ace woody pointing at fred this one over here calvin candie yes. ace woody to fred you fred a very scared fred answers. big fred yes, sir. ace woody well good to meetcha fred, imace woody, im a man of influence round here. now fred

shoots big fred in the back. candie acts out mock frustration. the remaining three mandingos jump a mile. calvin candie now why did you do that ace woody he won his last fight last night. ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos 1 00 ace woody to mandingos those of you with exceptional ability will find it aint so bad here. those of you who dont possess exceptional ability, will wish you did. ace looks up to cody on his horse. ace woody run em over to the arena. git em doin push ups. first one gives out, shoot em in the head. to mandingos welcome to candyland, boys cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena. candie leans over to schultz and says calvin candle we only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy. but those two tend to be lucky. ace woody hops back up on his horse. calvin candie you know mr.woody, im beginning to think that you dont trust my judgement ace woody just smiles at his boss, and says ace woody oh you know i always trust your judgement, boss candie...eventually. he rides off. stephen limps back to the action. calvin candie ahhh, stephen my boy, rooms ready stephen all ready for your guest and his nigger. candieshakes his head in mock frustration. calvin candie stephen, youre incorrigible. to schultz and django gentlemen, let stephen show you to your rooms. o calvin candle cont there you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours. then well have some lemonade, and ill show off some of my finer specimens. dr.schultz splendid. both dr.schultz and django climb down from their horses. candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named timmy. calvin candie timmy boy, go take their horses for em. fix em up at the stable, give em a load of oats. django hands the boy the reigns. django thats fritz, this is tony. you take good care of em now. timmy yes, sir. django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy. django once hes in the stable, give em that. he reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one. django give that one to fritz. timmy leads the horses away. the two visitors start to follow stephen to their rooms, when dr.schultz pretends to remember something dr.schultz oh, monsieur candie, about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about calvin candie nigger girl dr.schultz i believe you said she spoke german calvin candie oh yes, hildi, what about her ,oz. dr.schultz do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room calvin candie i dont see why not. to stephen stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch hildi. i want her cleaned up and smellin nice, and sent over to dr.schultzs room. stephen has to be the bearer of bad news. stephen actually... . monsieur candie... . theres somethin we aint tole you yet. calvin candie what stephen hildis in the hot box. this gets djangos, schultzs, and candies attention. calvin candie whats she doin there stephen what cha think she doin in the hot box, she bein punished. calvin candie what she do stephen she ran away again. calvin candie jesus christ, how many people ran away when i was gone stephen two. calvin candie when did she go stephen last night. they brought her back this morning. calvin candle how bad did stonesiphers dogs tear her up djangos hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. if they sicked those dogs on his angel, hes going to just kill all these motherfuckers right now. stephen lucky for her they were busy lookin for dartagnans ass. brown and cody went out lookin for her and found her. she a little beat up, but she did that to herself. runnin through them damn bushes. djangos hand moves away from his gun. calvin candie how long she been in the box stephen whatcha think, all goddamn day little fool got ten more days to go. calvin candle take her out. stephen incredulous take her out why calvin candle because i said so, thats why. hildi is my nigger. dr.schultz is my guest. southern hospitality dictates i make her available to him. stephen but monsieur candie, she just ran away calvin candle jesus christ stephen, whats the point of havin a nigger speaks german ifyou cant wheel em out when you have a german guest i realize its inconvenient. still, take her out. to cora and lara lee lara lee would you and cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for dr.schultz the overseers,tommy giles and hoot peters go to the hot.box. while billy crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water. django watches them walk to the hot box. dr.schultzs eyes shift to django, to watch him watch this. stephen notices djangos interest in both the hot box and whoevers sizzling in it. the hot box itself is a large iron solitary confinement cell door from yuma prison built into the ground. they put a key in the lock, and the two men lift the heavy iron door open. revealing a naked broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box dug into the ground. broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine. when ... billy crash tosses the bucket of water on her. django watches this. djangos pov.from his wide shot perspective we see them yank the naked broomhilda incoherent out of the hole. revenge music plays as we move into a sergio leone cu of djangos face. stephen breaks the mood. stephen to django you comin, or you wanna sleep in that little box django turns his back on the naked broomhilda and follows stephen and dr.schultz up the front steps of the big house. int  the big house  day stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of the big house. then down the hallway with the guest rooms. dr.schultz is shown his guest room by stephen. schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him. stephen takes django to the room next door, opens the door, and leads him in. int  djangos guest room  day a guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it. a little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it. 105 stephen this ones yours, boy. that beds damn nice too. django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out. broomhildas gone. as he looks through the glass, snotty stephen rattles on in the background. stephen feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin all this shit once you gone. ill have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready. django sits down on the bed. stephen turns to leave. django not so fast. stephen i got more important things to do then jaw with you. django nigger, when i say stop you plant roots. both the words and the tone stop stephen dead. he turns around. django this tiny bell on this little table... .is this for you i ring this, you do fer me stephen me or somebody. django reaches over and picks up the bell. a soft dingaling stephen unamused what cha want django i want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up. stephen does what hes told, but with attitude. o django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone. once stephens done, django stands up from the bed. django gimmie. stephen hands him the basin full of water. django takes it from him. then throws the water in stephens face. the dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man. django whatsamatter stephen, you dont like that django takes his hand and slaps the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor django thats my kinda bell ringin. git up. the old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor  as soon as he does  django slaps him to the floor again. then django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the floor below his knees. django ive known me house niggers like you my whole life. play your dog tricks with your massa. ya lip off to him every now an then, as long as ya keep it funny. he rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think its so cute. meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin and jumpin to stay on your good side. well this time snowball, you gonna listen to me. you got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, im gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of me beatin the black off your ass. i will make you drop your drawers, ill take off my belt, and i will wup your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation. and after i do that, lets see you play the rooster round here. x07 stephen calvin wouldnt. let you do it. django oh thats right, he gives you first name privileges... . aint that cute. sass me me again nigger, see what happen. stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue. django thats what i thought. now git outtahere. with as much dignity as he can muster, stephen stands up. before he leaves, django tells him, django when i ring this bell, you better come a runnin. you  not nobody else. while im on this property, you my nigger snowball. stephen leaves. django lies down on the bed. he covers his eyes with his arm. a door joins django and schultzs room. the adjoining door opens, and schultz stands there. dr.schultz was that wise django doesnt remove his arm from.his eyes. django he aint tellin nobody bout that. thats all that needs to be said. int  hallway big house  day lara lee, cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up shes dressed in a domestic maid uniform broomhilda stand outside dr.schultzs door, after calvins sister raps on it. dr.schultz opens the door. dr.schultz hello ladies. dog lara lee dr.schultz, may i introduce to you, hildi. hildi, this is dr.schultz, he speaks german. dr.schultz to broomhilda ive been informed you do as well. broomhilda german it would be my, pleasure to speak with you in german. schultz acts for the benefit of miss laras astonishment. dr.schultz astonishing. in german please come inside fraulein. she does, and justas lara lee is to say something, schultz says, thank you very much, and closes the door in her face. miss lara looks to her mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed. int  schultzs guest room big house  late afternoon with the door closed, schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl. he gives her a pleasant smile. dr.schultz they call you hildi, but your real name is broomhilda, isnt it broomhilda yes. how do you know that dr.schultz stands to reason who ever taught you german would also give you a german name. can i pour you a glass of water, broomhilda hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not to mention with a german accent, does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl. 107 we cut to django on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue to present himself. back to broomhilda and dr.schultz as dr.schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins talking to her in german subtitled in english dr.schultz german im aware you havent spoken german in a long while. so ill talk slowly. im only speaking german to you now, broomhilda, in case candies people are listening to us. myself and a mutual friend of ours, have gone through a lot of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to find you fraulein  to rescue you. he hands her a tall clear glass of water. she looks at him weird, rescue me dr.schultz german please drink. she absentmindedly obeys. dr.schultz .german. now its myself and our mutual friends intention to take you away from here forever. broomhilda german i dont got any friends. dr.schultz german yes you do. broomhilda german who dr.schultz german i cant tell you. our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic, and he wants to surprise you. 0 broomhilda german where is he he points at the adjoining door. dr.schultz german standing right behind that door. her head moves in the direction of the door. he looks to the young woman dr.schultz german promise me you wont scream she nods her head, yes. dr.schultz german say, i promise. broomhilda german i promise. dr.schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it. the door knob turns. the door slowly opens revealing... her husband django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up. he smiles at her, and says django hey little trouble maker. obviously a pet name between them. broomhilda goes into a bit of shock... .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and the water spills on the floor ... .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint. 11 the two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other dr.schultz you silver tongued devil you. montage we dissolve to later, as we see dr.schultz and django explain what theyre doing there, who theyre pretending to be, and what their plan is to broomhilda. we hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack. its not a happy tune.. .per se. but its pretty, and vaguely optimistic ... we dissolve to the slave pen the doomed men who didnt sell at greenville, brooding rodney and chester and chicken charly, spend their last night at candyland sleeping under the stars in the slave pen. the same whistling tune continues over this scene. rodney sees, the whole slave selling and buying group, django, dr.schultz, candie, bartholomew, moguy, ace woody, brown and cody, and the overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to the arena. laughin and joshin all the way. the hatred rodney feels for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker. a study in powerless fury. dissolve to broomhilda setting the dinner table in the dining room of the big house with its knives, spoons and forks. shes all by herself as she goes through this duty. the whistling tune weve been listening to has been coming from broomhilda whistling as she sets the table. suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears stephen. stephen what you. whistlin, girl broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in stephens direction. stephen what was you whistlin broomhilda oh nuttin. stephen you werent whistlin nothin, you were whistlin somethin. whatcha whistlin broomhilda i dunno. somethin i heard. i dont know no.name. z stephen its kinder pretty. she doesnt say anything in return. stephen that was a compliment. broomhilda thank you. stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to broomhilda. stephen im just sayin, two days ago you wus in such misery here, you hadda run off. so you run off, we catch your ass an drag you back. then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in the hot box for bout ten hours. now here you are two days later, whistlin while you work. im just sayin, i.wouldn think youd have a hellva lot to whistle bout. .im jus sayin. he watches the effect his words have on broomhildas face. broomhilda im done here, may i be excused stephen yes you may. she moves off to another part of the house. he watches her shuffle off. int  dining room big house  night later that evening, django and a lot of other white people calvin candie, lara lee, moguy, and dr.schultz sat around the dinner table. they are being served by the black people weve come to know at candyland stephen, cora, and because dr.schultz likes her broomhilda. along with an army of domestic slaves acting as wait service. knowing djangos a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the domestic slaves despise django. even broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade. we pick up the conversation in midnegotiation. 5. dr.schultz look monsieur candle, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it. but the best three, by far, were sampson, goldie, and eskimo joe.  by the way, whys he called eskimo joe calvin candie oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started. his name was joe...maybe one day he said he was cold.. .who knows dr.schultz irregardless, we all know samsons your best, and youll never sell him and i can see why, hes a champion. calvin candie all three are champions. django contradicts, as he chews his steak django samsons the champion. the other two are pretty good. all the domestic slaves around the table stiffen at witnessing django contradict calvin candie. including broomhilda, whos wielding the gravy boat. after django says that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on lara lees mashed potatoes. lara lee hildi broomhilda snaps back. instead of getting angry, candle seems to reflect on that analysis, then issues his own appraisal calvin candie can eskimo joe whip sampson, no. can he take goldie, probably not  goldies the best dirty fightin nigger i ever saw. but as long as you dont put em up against those two., eskimo joe will whip any niggers ass. django maybe. the domestics freeze for a jerky second when django says that.  f dr.schultz you must understand, monsieur candie, while admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight game, i do have a bit of a background in the european traveling circus. hence, i have big ideas when it comes to presentation. i need something more then just a big nigger. he needs to have panache. a sense of showmanship. i want to be able to . bill. him as. the black hercules. i said., and i quote i would pay top dollar for the, right nigger. now im not saying eskimo joe is the wrong nigger  per se ... but is he right as rain ...  everyone waits for calvins response. he milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep, then says calvin candie dr.schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, monsieur calvin j. candie. but one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game. beat a nigger that can win fights. that should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern. after you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design. but since i enjoy oldest man at the table status  beating moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first. broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans. dr.schultz says something pleasant to her in german.. she smiles, and says something pleasant back. calvin candie i see you two gettin on dr.schultz breaks into a wide grin dr.schultz .famously. dramatic pause monsieur candie, you cant imagine what its like not to hear you native tongue for four years. calvin candie hell, i cant imagine two weeks in boston. 5 everybody at the table chuckles. dr.schultz i cant express the joy i felt conversing in my mother tongue. and broomhilda is a charming conversation companion. as broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for moguy, lara lee notices how django and broomhilda look and try not to look at each other. stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for monsieur candie. lara lee i dont know doctor, you can lay on all the german sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for django. lara lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, django, broomhilda, and schultz, involuntarily jerk. and ... .stephen sees it. schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook. except for stephen, no one else was the wiser. broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen. stephen watches her go, then looks at django, then hands candie his mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the tables benefit. calvin candie stephen, youre amazing. i havent finished a drink in this house in twenty years. stephen when a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a cold drink. chuckle... . chuckle... calvin candie did you overhear that joke i said about me spending two weeks in boston stephen mock indignant you dont have any idea the work i do to see food gets on the table. 16 calvin candie what does that hafta do with the price of tea in china stephen you think when im in that kitchen, i got nothin better to do then listen in here to you tellin unfunny jokes chuckle... . chuckle... calvin candie mock indignation what they laughed stephen of course they laughed, their parents raised them right. when theyre a guest in somebodys house, and the master of of the house thinks hes funny, you suppose to laugh. theyd be rude not to. chuckle... .chuckle... they play their little comedy routine for all its worth. calvin candie no it was really funny, to table wasnt it stephen now what do you expect these people to say what you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest. to table everybody dont laugh at him, youre being polite, i understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him. chucklechuckle... as the white folks chuckle, stephen moves back into the kitchen. tnt  kitchen big house  night once stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks eyes on broomhilda. he moves over to her. stephen you know that nigger  she spins around. 11 7 broomhilda who stephen dont stall me bitch, you know who broomhilda at the table i dont know him. stephen. you dont know him broomhilda no. stephen you wouldnt lie to me now, would you she shakes her head, no. stephen looks at her skeptical. stephen okay, if you say so. back to dinner table pick it up again in midnegotiation. django eskimo joes a quality nigger, no doubt about it. but if it was my money, i wouldnt pay twelve thousand dollars for him. dr.schultz what would your price be django well, if i ,was inclined to be generous,. and i dont know why i would be inclined to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe. candies lawyer chimes in. moguy but the real question is, not how much he cost, but how much he can earn dr.schultz django django in a years time, seven or eight fights  outside of mississippi  where his candyland pedigree werent well known  virginia... cont 11y django cont georgia  all goes well ...twenty to twenty one thousand dollars. calvin candie precisely bright boy, good on ya. any way you cut that cake, that spells profit. not to, mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger. however let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about. it wasnt me who came to you to sell a nigger, it was you who approached me to buy one. now that nine thousand dollar figure bright boy was banding about, aint too far off from right. and if i wanted to sell eskimo joe for that, i could sell em any day of the week. but like you said in greenville doctor, i dont wanna sell em. it was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it. dr.schultz considerscalvin candies words, then suddenly says dr.schultz you know monsieur candie... . you do possess the power of persuasion. candie smiles at that remark. then suddenly schultz slaps the table hard with his hand, and says dr.schultz why not monsieur candie, you have a deal, eskimo joe, twelve thousand dollars the white people at the table get very happy. dr.schultz continues dr.schultz however, that is a tremendous amount of money. and the way you have your mr.moguy, i have a lawyer, a persnickety man named tuttle. and i would need my man to draw up a legal contract before i would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh. not to mention having eskimo joe examined by a physician of my choosing. so say i return in about five days time with my mr.tuttle. and then my mr.tuttle and your mr.moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves. 117 calvin candie splendid. calling to the kitchen stephen, time for dessert stephen, cora, broomhilda, and the other domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes. broomhilda goes to calvin. broomhilda can i take away your dishes, monsieur candle calvin candie yes you may, hildi. she begins gathering the dirty dishes. candie looks up at her as she works. calvin candie so hildi, how you like servin at the big table in the big house broomhilda i like it a lot monsieur candle. calvin candie its a lot better then sizzling in that hot box, or draggin your ass through a bramble bush, aint it broomhilda yes em. with candie interrogating broomhilda, django tenses up. stephen clocks this. stephen decides to test djangos reaction. stephen you know monsieur candle, the doctor might be interested in seein hildis peeled back. seein as he dont see many niggers where he from. calvin candie to schultz when you was alone with hildi here, didja just speak german, or did ya git her clothes off 20 dr.schultz we just spoke. calvin candie so you havent seen her back dr.schultz no i havent. calvin candie then stephens right, you would probably find this interesting. hildi, take off your dress, and show us your back. django hears this. broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to django. stephen clocks it. lara lee calvin, i just got her all dressed up and looking nice. calvin candie but lara lee, dr.schultz is from dusseldorf, they dont got niggers there. and hes a man of medicine. im sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain. i mean hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back. lara lee get one, shed lose her mind. these niggers are tough, no doubt about it. lara lee calvin, we are eating  dessert, no less. aint no one wanna see her whipped up back. django continues to watching this play out. stephen watches him. candie folds. calvin candie okay okay lara. maybe after dinner. during the brandies. broomhilda  dismissed  takes calvins dishes and heads back into the kitchen. stephen takes one more look at django, and follows broomhilda behind the kitchen door. 121 int  kitchen big house  night in the kitchen with the other domestics, stephen says to broomhilda stephen i thought you said you didnt know him broomhilda turns around. broomhilda huh stephen approaches her, the other domestics get quiet and watch. stephen i said, you said, you didnt know him broomhilda i dont. stephen yes you do. broomhilda mister stephen, i dont. stephen why you lyin to me as tears begin to well in her eyes. broombilda i aint. stephen why you cryin broomhilda because youre scarin me. stephen why am i scarin you broomhilda because youre scary. things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside. we hear dr.schultz in the next room say dr.schultz os .to speak german,with hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching. stephen hears this, hes starting to get the idea. 1zl his eyes to to broomhilda. stephen you, stay in the kitchen. stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches dr.schultz prepare to proposition candie for broomhilda. stephen knows these two jokers django and schultz are up to something, and now hes just figured it out. int  dinner table big house  night dr.schultz you indicated earlier you would be willing to part with hildi calvin candie yes siree bob i did. dr.schultz well in that case allow me to propose another proposition in full ole jimmie performance, stephen barges in the room, interrupting dr.schultz. stephen  monsieur candie calvin candie stephen, you just interrupted dr.schultz. stephen to dr.schultz oh, i do apologize, doctor. my hearin aint worth a damn these days. to candie monsieur candie, i need a word with you in the kitchen. calvin candie what, you mean get outta my chair stephen if you could manage it. its about dessert. calvin candie what about dessert stephen i would rather tell you in private. calvin candie were having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there 123 stephen bends down and whispers in his ear stephen meet me in the library. well thats a horse of a different color. that means whatever stephen has to say, hasnt anything to do with rhubarb pie. meet me in the library is their secret signal. calvin candie fine friend stephen, ill be along momentarily. stephen exits. candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table. calvin candie well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required. if youll excuse me a moment. candie exits. tnt  library big house  night a masculine sanctuary for calvin candie. walls of perfectly bound books. stuffed animal heads deer, boar that hes shot, sit mounted on the walls. theres comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe. when we cut to this room, we cut to stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter. calvin enters the room, sees stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his brandy, and doesnt bat an eye. it appears, in this room, calvins and stephens life long friendship exits on a different plane. outside of outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of candyland can talk turkey. calvin candie whats the matter stephen those motherfuckers aint here to buy no mandingos. they want that girl.  calvin candie what the hell you talkin about stephen they playin your ass for a fool, thats what im talkin bout. they aint here for no muscle bound jimmie, they here

done changed is the advantage. beat now we got it. .so lets go back in there and busts these motherfuckers chops. int  dining room big house  night the dinner table guests listen to lara leecandiefitzwilly hold court melodramatically ... . till ... . calvin candie enters the room from the kitchen door. lara lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon seeing him lara lee there you are i was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together. schultz and django feel the change in their hosts demeanor, as he stares down the table at them. calvin candle thatd be a hellva note, wouldnt it lara lee cont 1z j calvin candie cont lara lee, i just looked out the big winda. ace woodys out there dealin with some shady slaver sellin a passel of ponys. would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball. that of boy knows everything to know bout mandingos, but he dont know diddly bout black puddin. lara lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out, bartholomew, with his sawed off shotgun, comes.in behind schultz and django. calvin candie can i ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder schultz and django do, and see bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them. calvin candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand hes holding a big ugly hammer. calvin candie now lay your palms flat on the table top. they put their palms on the table. calvin candie now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top, bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off. theres been a lotta lies said around this table tonightbut that.. .you can believe. beat mr.moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin on those boyships mr.moguy does. holding the hammer in his hand, candie continues to hold court. calvin candie now where were we oh yes, i do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy broomhilda. right dr.schultz right. calvin candie yelling to stephen stephen bring out hildi ix stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding roughly in his grip, broomhilda. he holds a small derringer pistol against the side of her head. django and schultz react. calvin candie now it should be quite clear by now i know youre not here to buy no mandingos. reason yall came to candyland, is yall want broomhilda. but yall dont want me to know how much you want er. so instead, you waste my time with all this eskimo joe horseshit. to stephen stephen, put her in that chair. stephen sits the young lady down in moguys old chair. with their palms against the table, unarmed, django and schultz silently watch candies next move. candie, still holding the hammer, continues. calvin candie now the way i see it, aint nothin changed.. you still wanna buy a nigger, i still wanna sell one. so, with that in mind, in greenville, dr.schultz, you yourself said, for the right nigger youd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount. to which, me myself said, what is your definition of ridiculous to which you said, twelve thousand dollars. now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would appear that broomhilda is, the right nigger. and if yall wanna leave candyland with broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars. dr.schultz i take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating. candie continuing to hold the hammer continues. calvin candie under the laws of chickasaw county, broomhilda is my property. and i can do anything with my property i so desire. he brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making everybody jump. in calvin candie and if you think my price for this nigger is too steep, what im gonna desire to do is, take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it. right in front of both yall. he smashes the arm rest of the chair broomhildas sitting in. calvin candie put up or shut up, schultz. you wanna save this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price. dr.schultz may i lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold calvin candie yes you may. dr.schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket, and says, dr.schultz easy come, easy go. he slides the billfold down the table to candie. the plantation owner takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at the seated schultz, and says calvin candie pleasure doin business with you. time cut int  dining room big house  night insert calvin signing over broomhildas bill of sale. .moguy signs as a witness. broomhilda stands next to django, and watches her master sign her freedom papers. dr.schultz sits off by himself. hes very disturbed. all the white people with calvin candie are happy and celebrate candies successes with glasses of brandy. lara lee, ace woody, and brown and cody have joined the celebration. for an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend. he just sold a pony, with a tore up back, and a runaway r burned in her cheek  aint worth five hundred dollars for twelve thousand. stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else. the other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people. candie walks over to the seated schultz, he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him. calvin candie to schultz rhubarb pie schultz looks at the pie and the man. dr.schultz no. calvin candie are you brooding bout me getting the best of ya dr.schultz actually, i was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, dartagnan. and i was wondering what dumas would make of all this. calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. broomhildas bill of sale, and her freedom papers. as he says the following he examines he papers. calvin candie dumas... dr.schultz alexander dumas. he wrote the three musketeers. i figured you must be an admirer. you named your slave after that novels lead character. if alexander dumas had been there today, i wonder what he would of made of it calvin candie you doubt hed approve dr.schultz yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best. calvin candie soft hearted frenchy dr.schultz alexander dumas is black. 1 30 schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two companions, django and broomhilda, and says dr.schultz we got it, lets go. to candie normally monsieur candie, i would say, auf wiedersehen. but since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till i see you again, and since i never wish to see you again, to you sir, i say, goodbye. schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. when calvin says to the germans back calvin candie one more moment, doc dr.schultz what calvin candie its a custom here in the south, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. it implies good faith. dr.schultz im not from the south. he turns to leave. calvin candie youre in my house, doctor, im afraid i must insist. this turns schultz around. dr.schultz insist what... that i shake your hand before i leave then im afraid i must insist in the opposite direction. calvin walks closer to the german doctor. calvin candie you know what i think you are dr.schultz what you think i am no i dont. 1310, calvin candle i think you are a bad loser. dr.schultz and i think youre an abysmal winner. calvin candle never the less, here in chickasaw county a deal aint done till the two parties have shook hands. even after all this paper signin, dont mean shit you dont shake my hand. dr.schultz if i dont shake your hand, youre gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars... i dont think so. schultz looks to django and broomhilda. dr.schultz lets go. calvin candie bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this german shakes my hand. cut er down. schultz looks to django... . then to candle.. .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks candle dr.schultz. you really want me to shake your hand django gets it. calvin candie i insist. dr schultz smiles. dr.schultz well, if you insist. django goes to stop him... 1 714 the german crosses toward candie, offering him his hand... candie offers his hand to schultz... the small derringer pops into schultzs outstretched hand... pop he shoots calvin candie in the heart. candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. everybody is stunned. schultz looks to django. django looks back. dr.schultz to django im sorry. i couldnt resist. dr.schultz is blown apart by bartholomews sawed off shotgun. the room comes to its senses and attacks django and broomhilda. fade to black we fade up from black to see the soles of djangos bare feet. a rope is tied around the ankles, and its obvious hes been strung up, upside down. the camera moves down his naked body, down his legs we see his wrists arebound with ropes to his thigh, down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor. int  barn  afternoon eight year old stable boy, timmy, wipes the unconscious djangos face with a wet rag. they are all alone in the barn. django begins to come to ... timmy shhhs him act like you still sleepin. django wheres broomhilda timmy who django hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. they had her in the hot box. timmy i dont know bout no girl. django how bout that german white man i came here with timmy oh hes dead. his bodys over there. django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend king schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. the sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills django with pain and anger. just then head overseer ace woody walks in the barn. upon seeing ace, timmy hightails it out of there, ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy. ace woody git on outta here, boy 133 django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at ace woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like wyatt earp. ace woody so yall bounty hunters,.huh django thinks, how does he know ace woody i knew there was something fishy bout, yall. we found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. i gotta say, aint never heard of no black bounty hunter before. a black boy paid to kill white men how did ya like that line of work django retorts, upside down. django well, it turns out i was a natural. ace woody laughs. ace woody boy, people round here are cross wit you. ace woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body length from the hanging man. ace woody see boss man was a rather beloved figure round here. now hes dead as fried chicken, everyone round here blames you. ace woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist, he carries a huge bowie knife ina shoulder holster. he removes the big blade from its sheath. ace woody yep, boss mans gone. poor calvin. poor goddamn calvin. were burnin him in a few hours. at sunset. should be real pretty. however ... . i dont think youre gonna be able to attend. ace takes the bowie knife and throws it... . it lands stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from djangos face. ace woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and django, pulls the blade out of the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down. as he does this, he says ace woody now i understand you didnt really have nuttin to do wit it. its that german sunbitch the trouble maker. you just wanted to git your girl, and hightail your nigger asses outta here. now i appreciate that. but grieving folks round here need someone to blame. and i guess they figure if you hadnt brought your black ass round here in the first place, boss man still be alive. and you know what, they got a point. he throws the knife again... .this time it lands in the floor two inches from djangos face. he walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool. as he does he says ace woody now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways, believe me when i. tell you, i know every goddamn trick in the book. now theres a lotta ass busters out there try an git creative with the way they bust ass. but me... .i always found the best methods are, tried and true. he throws the knife again... django jerks his head back ... .and the knife lands in the floor, right where djangos head was. ace woody stands up, walks the floor to the bowie, yanks it out of the wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man. ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy. ace woody you know blackie, here at candyland, i had me a real sweet deal. these last eleven years training calvins mandingos i made me more money i made my whole goddamn life. and no end in sight, neither. beat then you came along. knocked me right off that perch i was sittin pretty on. you think miss lara gonna be as.interested in mandingos as her brother uuummmm...i dont think so. what i think, is you done fucked up my good thang. so when it comes to you, django boy, you could say i gotta axe to grind. ijs he grabs a handfull of djangos genitals in his fist. he takes his big bowie, and places the razor sharp blade against djangos nut sack. django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole. ace woody hows the blade of that bowie feel against your ball sack, blackie a bowie right off the wet stone. now thats what i call sharp. django dances some more ... ace woody yep nigger, im gonna snip them nuts. breath on the count of three. django screams django no ace woody one ... django no dont do it ace woody got to do it, boy. two... django no  just then stephen appears in the entrance of the barnblacksmith facility. hes holding djangos clothes in a bundle under his arm. stephen capt, miss lara lookin for you. she wanna talk about the old mans funeral. oh, and she changed her mind bout snippin django. she gonna give em to the lequint dickey people. while still keeping a firm grip on djangosjunk, ace woody says ace woody well she didnt waste a minute tellin me. ace woody looks down at django, both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened. ace woody to django how disappointing. 171 ace woody to stephen where she at stephen she in the big house. the kitchen. ace turns to leave, stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn, and begins poking a long poker which lies buried in the fire. djangos clothes are dumped by the furnace. ace woody you gonna look after our friend as, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says stephen oh yes sirree bob, you know i am 01 snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know, gonna have us a big of chat. he removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, its red hot end glows orange. stephen snowballs just makin sure his talking stick is all nice and frosty. ace woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn. just stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down django, alone. with the red hot poker in his hand snowball approaches the naked hanging django. stephen i bet you an that german thought yall was on easy street for awhile  didnt ya yall track hildi to the old man. you get the idea to go to greenville  look up the ole man there. breath that was a good idea. i bet yall couldnt believe how easy it was. you meet moguy, he buys your horseshit. ya git your ass invited to candyland, no fuss no muss. ya ride the whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser. then ya ride in to candyland  ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking big house. 137 stephen beat and thats where you met me. and thats when you knew your goose was cooked. he touches djangos nipple with the orange hot tip of the poker. unlike a lot of movie heros, django doesnt take torture silently and stoically. this shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot poker. stephen now that fancy talkin white man of yours didnt know whats what. he still thought his ass hadda chance. but like the oneeyed charly you are, you always know the end is near fore the white folks. with the orange hot poker, he burns off djangos other nipple. the smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils. stephen damn nigger, you smell good. he walks behind django with the poker. stephen you know, when you was sittin on that feather bed in the quest room in the big house  after you slapped my ass to the floor you were sayin something bout my bare black ass, and how you were gonna bust it. remember that, bright boy he places the hot orange end of the poker hard against djangos bare buttocks. django screams stephen laughs. stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. he goes through djangos clothes and pulls out his tan pants. he tosses them on the floor by the hanging man. stephen you leavin, thats what you can take with you. stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to him, he begins fondling djangos genitals. i31 stephen now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours. seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin up with different ways to kill your ass. now most of dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts. but while that might seem like a good idea. truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out. then i say hells bells, the niggers we send to lequint dickey, got it worse then that. then theyre, lets whip em to death, throw em to the mandingos, feed em to stonesiphers dogs. and then i say, whats so special bout that we do that shit all the time. hells bells, the niggers we send to lequint dickey got it worse then that. he stops massaging djangos balls. stephen so miss lara got the bright idea of givin your ass to the lequint dickey mining company. and as a slave of the lequint dickey mining company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks. and trust me when i tell you its gonna be bout as much fun as it sounds. we sell em the mandingos aint good for nuttin no more. like them three yall came back with. for them big garboons we get twenty a piece. they last bout six months. skinny nigger like you, i give two or three. stephen turns to leave. django wheres broomhilda stephen shes all right for now. miss lara soft hearted on er. she gave her to billy crash. he was sweet on er. now billy crash might not look or smell too good, but aint nobody gonna bother her. stephen limps away. cut to 137 ext  candyland  afternoon the caravan coming from the lequint dickey mining company comes riding up to the plantation. it comes equipped with one cage wagon from a

django that black ride into candyland yesterday the caged men dont know what theyre suppose to say. roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points the barrel at the cage. roy im gonna ask again, and remember i dont like liars. is he a candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man yesterday chester yeah. they walked us from the greenville auction and he rode on a

laughing you got a deal, black. django interrupts  django you gotta deal, mate. roy really laughs this time. as does django and the other two aussies. roy youre all right for a black fella the cage rodney, chicken charly, and chester watch the sight of the white men cutting the ropes that bound the black mans wrists, as well as them all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. who is this nigger back

chuckle yeah, i can see why. jano take those sticks off that horse, and stick em in the nigger cage. jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking  the cage door, and placing the bags inside. the black men in the cage dont like this at all. jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from djangos horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to the cage wagon. django moves to his new pack horse, and says django wheres my pistol roy floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give em your gun and your belt. floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over to django handing it to him. django accepts it. about the pistol, floyd tells django floyd now dont drop it now. i just had the sights fixed last month, its perfect. django holding the gunbelt in his hand. django thats good to know. without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, django shoots floyd twice in the chest... roy turns around... django takes the gun out of the holster... . bam...roy is hit in the upper brain area and falls to the grass dead. jano goes for the gun on his hip. django shoots one of the saddle bags over.janos shoulder...kahboom jano is blown to smithereens... the kahboom knocks django on his ass... the cage wagon rodney, chester, and chicken charlie come down from the shock of the blast. the image outside the bars of their cage is of dust and smoke in the air, obscuring all visibility... then ... a sudden gust of wind comes and blows all the smoke and dust away, revealing in bright color focus... .django standing among the two dead aussies, and whatever is left of jano. hes shoeless and shirtless, but floyds pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist. he locks eyes with the three men in the cage.. he then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast, and climbs aboard him bareback. he leans over and snatches the rifle that floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him. grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the beasts side. the pack animals springs to life under the new rider. by now it should be apparent that django brings the best out of horses, and horses bring the best out of django. from his high horse django looks down at the three caged men... .then... using the rifle in a quick one handed move he shoots the lock on the cage door. he looks at the three men, especially rodney, then says django throw up that dynamite. rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to django on his horse. django wraps it around the horses neck, turns the beast around, and without saying another word, rides back in the direction of candyland. the three now free mandingos, watch him ride away. who was that nigger cut to l.rz a gorgeous big sky southern purple and orange sunset we pan down from the sky and see in small black silhouette the funeral procession of calvin candie carrying the coffin of the former master up the hill on candyland that leads to the graveyard. a white preacher walks out in front of the procession. then comes calvin candies coffin carried by eight pallbearers, stephen, moguy, bartholomew, ace woody, brown, cody, and his best mandingos samson and goldie. the first mourner in line is lara lee dressed in a fancy black dress, wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black mammy cora crying at her side. cora the skys real pretty miss lara. monsieur candie think it real nice. lara lee ah, bless you sweet innocent cora. we cross cut with shots of django riding the horse on the way back to candyland. the bare backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the rifle in one hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a gorgeous sunset sky, looks like an indian. ext  tracker shackbunkhouse  sunset the same gorgeous sunset sky over the same shitty tracker shack bunkhouse that mr.stonesipher and his three obscure companions share. the german shepherds including marsha rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse. int  tracker shack  sunset the four trackers are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards. mr.stonesipher, lex, and stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of your cards is different. instead of chips they play with, nigger ears yes, the ears of slaves. on a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at candyland are missing one ear. jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small delicate birdhouse hes making. ext  woodsoutside the shack  sunset insert horse hoofs walking then stopping. djangos bare feet jump on to the ground. is3 int  dog kennel  sunset the four dogs lay out... . when, marsha hears something, and raises her head... shirtless django moves quietly through the woods. marsha rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three pals continue to lay out. django by a tree he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the long handle axe buried in the chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way. marsha bark the other three dogs wake up, and go on alert. django disappears. int  tracker shack  sunset they hear the barking inside. mr.stonesipher jake jake building his birdhouse. jake yeah mr.stonesipher check on marsha. jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to check on them these guys are very sensitive about their dogs. ext  tracker shack as the barking gets louder, we see a close up of the axe in the chopping block, and djangos hand removing it. jake opens the bunkhouse doorhe sees directly a hundred feet in front of him, django standing there with the axe. just as he reacts... django ... . throws the axe... jake ... . it hits him in the face. after letting go of the axe handle, django runs full speed toward jake. before the other three have really registered whats happening, django has crossed the distance, and is yanking the axe out of jakes face. and with axe in hand, django chases and fights with all three trackers, till after a point where hes chopped down two of them, lex, and stew, and now theres only mr.stonesipher left. but mr.stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic buck knife, and is able to fight back against django. you know stonesiphers great with a knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack attack. django uses the axe handle in a defensive position. the expert mountain boy begins scoring blade cuts on shirtless django. the two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. then its just a fight of brute strength, and survival. mr.stonesipher is physically bigger then django. but if djangos going to save broomhilda, not to mention get revenge on all these candyland motherfuckers, he has to take stonesiphers ass out. this black man who has been under the yoke of white mans domination all his life, and this white man who feeds black people to dogs, fight each other for their life. django gets his arm around stonesiphers neck in a headlock, but the mountain boy is big enough to lift django. so like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life, django tightens his lock around his opponents neck. django gets his hand on the hammer jake was building the birdhouse with, and brings it crashing down on the top of stonesiphers head. that weakens stonesipher. he hits him again in the head. that drops stonesipher to his knees. he hits him again with the hammer on the head. that puts the mountain man down on his back. he hits him one more time with the hammer to keep him down for good. the trackers are all dead. only the dogs mad barking remains. ext  the funeral  night the funeral for calvin candie is underway. the preacher reads some words over him. ext  tracker shack  night django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps out of the shack. he takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks over to the water pump. marsha and her three friendscontinue to bark like mad. he pumps a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. he begins washing the bloodoffof himself. as he washes, he says outloud django what ya doin around here, boy timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes. timmy i was just walkin by. django wanna help me out timmy sure. django my woman, hildi, is with billy crash. you know where his shack is timmy sure do. django you show me timmy will i get in trouble django not by the time i get through killin everybody. timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. he believes him. timmy ill show ya. then ... django turns towards the barking dogs. he turns back to timmy and asks django you know what toadstools look like 15c timmy sure do. django go pick me a mess of em. insert timmy picking toadstools poison mushroms. insert django stirring a big pot of beef stew with a wooden spoon in the tracker shack. timmy comesin carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt. django takes the toadstools and mr.stonesiphers buck knife and chops the mushrooms into tiny pieces. he tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and mixes it up with the spoon. ext  marshas kennel  night django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel. it lands on the ground with a plop. the angry dogs, are nevertheless, still dogs, and greedily scarf up the stew. django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile. django you bit your last nigger, bitch bite on that. django lifts timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse. django first things first, boy. take me to my horse. ext  funeral night the funeral is in full melodramatic bore. tnt  stableblacksmith  night timmy brings django to the stable on the candyland grounds. django goes straight up to the stall housing tony and says hello. tonys happy to see him. django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him. he turns and sees the body of dr.schultz lying in a heap. and schultzs horse fritz in the stable. django saddle up fritz and tony. timmy just stares. django now, boy timmy hops to work. django bends down over the body of dr.schultz, he takes broomhildas bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. he also searches for and finds schultzs hidden derringer, he keeps it in a holster around his ankle. as timmy saddles the horses, he asks timmy do you feel bad for your friend django rises from the body of his friend. django yeah, i do. as timmy saddles the horses he says timmy i know just how ya feel. i lost a white friend once. he drowned in the lake. django doesnt correct the difference between dr.schultz and a white friend, because theres nothing he could say to timmy to make him understand. he goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the furnace. he puts on his boots. his green jacket over his bare chest. and finally his hat. ext  the funeral  night the service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands, and beginning to leave. int  billy crashs shack  night billy crash is in bed fucking broomhilda. she doesnt wail, she doesnt make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water. as billys fucking her he says billy crash its gonna be real nice round here now the ol mans gone. cont sr billy crash fucks would you stop your galdarn cryin he stops fucking in frustration broomhilda i cant. billy crash now girl, im tryin to be nice. broomhilda i cant help it im really sad he

always been sweet on you. i dont wanna bust your ass. so dont make me now im gonna go shit. you calm down. he exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving broomhilda alone. we move into a close up of broomhilda lying on the bed. she cries for django, she cries for herself... .then... she hears an impact sound, and a muffled ooomph sound. and through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in billy crashs shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground. then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door. cu broomhilda her face, stained with tears, watches the door. a soft knock knock on the door. broomhilda softly yes the voice on the other side of the door, says djangos voice os hey little trouble maker. 157 she hops out of bed, and throws open the door... there he is, she runs into his arms. ext  the funeral  night the two old slave.grave diggers are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on monsieur calvin j. candies coffin. the participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. the funeral is a private affair, just the candie family unit, some of the overseers, and the slaves. no one from town, except the preacher. the slave mourners begin. to move towards their living area, all saying goodbye to miss lara. miss lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them. a little cognizant of the candie family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house. ext  billy crashs shack  night django with broomhilda. billy crash lies dead in the b.g., stonesiphers buck knife buried deep in his chest. he hands broomhilda her papers. django heres your bill of sale, and freedom papers. no matter what happens to me, hold on to these and get out of the south. broomhilda whats gonna happen to you django

funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house. 60 ext  the trail back to the big house  night the family unit of the late calvin candie and his sister lara lee walk back to the big house for a drink. this candie family unit consists of lara lee unarmed in her black flowing funeral dress. cora unarmed her mammy, walks with miss lara, holding her hand. stephen. unarmed dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal house nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress miss lara, holding her other hand. ace woody armed with a gun belt.around his hip dressed in his wyatt earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself. leonide moguy armed with a gun belt around his hip walks by himself. bartholomew unarmed dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with his hat, walks alone. brown and jingle bells cody both armed with guns on their hips both dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together. and finally, samson and goldie unarmed calvin candies two prized mandingos, wearing suits they borrowed from bartholomew.. this candie family unit walk to the big house for a few post funeral drinks. they enter the lawn in front of the big house, and head for the front door. broomhilda on fritz and timmy riding on tony come along the side of the property by some shed. they see the candie family unit, all dressed in their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of the big house. the woman and little boy stop. but the group of enemies arent looking their way. the candie family unit moves closer towards the front of the big house... when ... the front of the big house explodes knocking the.candie family unit flat on their collective asses. broomhilda and timmy cant believe their eyes. i6 i wood  stone  plaster  dirt  dust  glass  smoke  gunpowder hang in the air. the candie family unit starts coming to their senses. nobody was killed, or even seriously hurt unless you count eardrums, just stunned. as their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust. thesmoke and dust thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated, but the big house front steps remain. cue cool music. stephen sees something in the smoke, squints. ace woody sees something in the smoke, squints. brown and cody see something in the smoke, squint. in the smoke and dust we begin to see a figure, walking towards them. ace woody squints at the figure. moguy sees the.figure. cora attending to miss lara sees the figure, then miss lara sees it. the figure moves further out of the smoke and dust. ace woody, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist. then he sees the figure.is carrying something in his left hand... .its floyds winchester, he raises it, and points it at ace. ace woodys hand moves away from his gun. the figure steps out of the smoke. its django dressed in his django outfit. stephen, ace woody, moguy, lara lee, bartholomew, cora, brown and jingle bells cody, sampson or goldie...nobody can believe djangos standing there. he stands at the top of the front steps of the big house, looking down at the candie family unit, all lying on the front lawn, winchester rifle held casually in his left hand. his right hand held casually by the gun on his hip. the candie family unit all on their ass in the grass, look up at django with a mixture of wonder, fear, and hate. icz we move into a romantic close up of broomhilda as she watches this. as django looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on the big house front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him. the black man in the cool green jacket says django i bet i.know what youre thinkin, ace woody

django everybody stand up its now django who gives the orders. they stand up quickly. django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at the candie family unit. enjoying their collective hatred. then... he tosses the rifle away. then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a showdown stance. everybody realizes djangos intentions. even broomhilda and timmy. django looks down from his position at the top of the big house steps at the ten people, and says django all black folks, take ten steps away from the white folks. djangos eyes go to stephen, who looks back at him. django not you stephen. youre right where you belong. 163 the black folks, cora, bartholomew, samson, and goldie begin taking ten steps away from the white folks and the gunfight. lara lee

shooting instantly all five white people and stephen standing in front of him. they all fall to grass in different ways.. it was never any contest, they and we the audience just didnt know how good django was. flash on django showing off his incredible fast draw and accurate marksmanship to dr.schultz. dr.schultz smiling you know what theyre going to call you, my boy the fastest gun in the

fathom what theyjust witnessed. 65 all the candie family unit lies on the grass shot. but some are still alive. we hear moaning coming from lara lee, cody, and moguy. django sees this. the black man reaches behind him and comes out with a dynamite stick. he tosses it on the grass among the bodies. he takes aim with his pistol and fires. it explodes. finishing off what was left of the candie family unit, not to mention, blowing the limbs off of many of them. the lawn is silent. djangos pistol goes back in its holster. django walks down the front steps of the big house, feeling tremendous satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on candie and co. he removes dr.schultzs tiny derringer from stephens dead hand, putting it in his pocket. then heads over to where broomhilda and timmy wait for him with fritz and tony. as he,walks up to broomhilda on fritz, he says django hey little trouble maker. broomhilda hey big trouble maker. django down, boy. timmy hops off of tony. django climbs

jammed, theres a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. two of these people are a young man and a young woman. the young man has a slight workingclass english accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like theyre going out of style. it is impossible to tell where the young woman is from or how old she is everything she does contradicts something she did. the boy and girl sit in a booth. their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace his girl friday fashion. young man no, forget it, its too risky. im through doin that shit. young woman you always say that, the same thing every time never again, im through, too dangerous. young man i know thats what i always say. im always right too, but  young woman  but you forget about it in a day or two  young man  yeah, well, the days of me forgittin are over, and the days of me rememberin have just begun. young woman when you go on like this, you know what you sound like young man i sound like a sensible fucking man, is what i sound like. young woman you sound like a duck. imitates a duck quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack... young man well take heart, cause youre never gonna hafta hear it again. because since im never gonna do it again, youre never gonna hafta hear me quack about how im never gonna do it again. young woman after tonight. the boy and girl laugh,

young woman oh yes, thank you. the waitress pours the young womans coffee. the young man lights up another cigarette. young man im doin fine. the waitress leaves. the young man takes a drag off of his smoke. the young woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. the young man goes right back into it. young man i mean the way it is now, youre takin the same fuckin risk as when you rob a bank. you take more of a risk. banks are easier  federal banks arent supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. theyre insured, why should they care you dont even need a gun in a federal bank. i heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said we got this guys little girl, and if you dont give him all your money, were gonna kill er. young woman did it work young man fuckin a it worked, thats what im talkin about knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin phone, cleans the place out, and they dont lift a fuckin finger. young woman did they hurt the little girl young man i dont know. there probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isnt the little girl. the point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone. young woman you wanna rob banks young man im not sayin i wanna rob banks, im just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin. young woman so you dont want to be a bank robber young man naw, all those guys are goin down the same road, either dead or servin twenty. young woman and no more liquor stores young man what have we been talking about yeah, no moreliquorstores. besides, it aint the giggle it usta be. too many foreigners own liquor stores. vietnamese, koreans, they cant fuckin speak english. you tell em empty out the register, and they dont know what it fuckin means. they make it too personal. we keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers gonna make us kill em. young woman im not gonna kill anybody. young man i dont wanna kill anybody either. but theyll probably put us in a situation where its us of them. and if its not the gooks, it these old jews whove owned the store for fifteen fuckin generations. ya got grandpa irving sittin behind the counter with a fuckin magnum. try walkin into one of those stores with nothin but a telephone, see how far it gets you. fuck it, forget it, were out of it. young woman well, what else is there, day jobs young man laughing not this life. young woman well what then he calls to the waitress. young man garcon coffee then looks to his girl. young man this place. the waitress comes by, pouring him some more. waitress snotty garcon means boy. she splits. young woman here its a coffee shop. young man whats wrong with that people never rob restaurants, why not bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin up one of them. restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. theyre not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting. young woman taking to idea i bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor. young man correct. just like banks, these places are insured. the managers dont give a fuck, theyre just tryin to get ya out the door before you start pluggin diners.  waitresses, forget it, they aint takin a bullet for the register. busboys, some wetback gettin paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck youre stealin from the owner. customers are sittin there with food in their mouths, they dont know whats goin on. one minute theyre havin a denver omelet, next minute somebodys stickin a gun in their face. the young woman visibly takes in the idea. the young man continues in a low voice. young man see, i got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. member all those customers kept comin in young woman yeah. young man then you got the idea to take everybodys wallet. young woman uhhuh. young man that was a good idea. young woman thanks. young man we made more from the wallets then we did the register. young woman yes we did. young man a lot of people go to restaurants. young woman a lot of wallets. young man pretty smart, huh the young woman scans the restaurant with this new information. she sees all the patrons eating, lost in conversations. the tired waitress, taking orders. the busboys going through the motions, collecting dishes. the manager complaining to the cook about something. a smiles breaks out on the young womans face. young woman pretty smart. into it im ready, lets go, right here, right

back at him. young woman i love you, pumpkin. young man i love you, honey bunny. and with that, pumpkin and honey bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. pumpkins robbery persona is

vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. the two men empty their guns at the same time

run for their money. theyre all basically the same. decor out of an archie comic book, golden oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the fats domino cheeseburger, or the wolfman jack omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit. but then theres jackrabbit slims, the big mama of 50s diners. either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view. vincents malibu pulls up to the restaurant. a big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment. underneath the cartoon is the name jackrabbit slims. underneath that is the slogan next best thing to a time machine. vincent what the fuck is this place mia this is jackrabbit slims. an elvis man should love it. vincent come on, mia, lets go get a steak. mia you can get a steak here, daddyo. dont be a... mia draws a square with her hands. dotted lines appear on the screen, forming a sqaure. the lines disperse. vincent after you, kittycat. int. jackrabbit slims  night compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint english pub. posters from 50s a.i.p. movies are all over the wall rock all night, high school confidential, attack of the crab monster, and machine gun kelly. the booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars. in the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. a big sign on the wall states, no shoes allowed. some wannabe beboppers actually melrosetypes, do the twist in their socks or barefeet. the picture windows dont look out the street, but instead, b  w movies of 50s street scenes play behind them. the waitresses and waiters are made up as replicas of 50s icons marilyn monroe, zorro, james dean, donna reed, martin and lewis, and the philip morris midget, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes. vincent and mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 59 edsel. buddy holly their waiter, comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says hi im buddy, pleasing you please me. buddy hi, im buddy, what can i getcha vincent ill have the douglas sirk steak. buddy how dya want it, burnt to a

dollars buddy yep. vincent you dont put bourbon in it or anything buddy nope. vincent just checking. buddy exits. vincent takes a look around the place. the yuppies are dancing, the diners are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. marilyn is squealing, the midget is paging philip morris, donna reed is making her customers drink their milk, and dean and jerry are acting a fool. mia whaddya think vincent its like a wax museum with a pulse rate. vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. after a second of watching him  mia what are you doing vincent rollin a smoke. mia here vincent its just tobacco. mia oh. well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy as he finishes licking it  vincent you can have this one, cowgirl. he hands her the rolled smoke. she takes it, putting it to her lips. out of nowhere appears a zippo lighter in vincents hand. he lights it. mia thanks. vincent think nothing of it. he begins rolling one for himself. as this time, the sound of a subway car fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle. marilyn monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. an imaginary subway train blows the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. the entire restaurant applauds. back to mia and vincent. mia marsellus said you just got back from amsterdam. vincent sure did. i heard you did a pilot. mia that was my fifteen minutes. vincent what was it mia it was show about a team of female secret agents called fox force five. vincent what mia fox force five. fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks. force, as in were a force to be reckoned with. five, as in theres one... two ... three... four... five of us. there was a blonde one, sommerset oneal from that show baton rouge, she was the leader. a japanese one, a black one, a french one and a brunette one, me.  we all had special skills. sommerset had a photographic memory, the japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the french fox specialty was sex... vincent what was your specialty mia knives. the character i played, raven mccoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. so she grew up doing a knife act. according to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. but because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. she could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist  when youre keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artists gonna come in handy. and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. if we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke. vincent do you remember any of the jokes mia well i only got the chance to say one, cause we only did one show. vincent tell me. mia no. its really corny. vincent cmon, dont be that way. mia no. you wont like it and ill be embarrassed. vincent you told it in front of fifty million people and you cant tell it to me i promise i wont laugh. mia laughing thats what im afraid of. vincent thats not what i meant and you know it. mia youre quite the silver tongue devil, arent you vincent i meant i wouldnt laugh at you. mia thats not what you said vince. well now im definitely not gonna tell ya, cause its been built up too much. vincent what a gyp. buddy comes back with the drinks. mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake. mia yummy vincent can i have a sip of that id like to know what a fivedollar shake tastes like. mia be my guest. she slides the shake over to him. mia you can use my straw, i dont have kooties. vincent smiles. vincent yeah, but maybe i do. mia kooties i can handle. he takes a sip. vincent goddamn thats a pretty fuckin good milk shake. mia told ya. vincent i dont know if its worth five dollars, but its pretty fuckin good. he slides the shake back. then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens. mia dont you hate that vincent what mia uncomfortable silences. why do we feel its necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable vincent i dont know. mia thats when you know you found somebody special. when you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence. vincent i dont think were there yet. but dont feel bad, we just met each other. mia well ill tell you what, ill go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say. vincent ill do that. int. jackrabbit slims ladies room  night mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. her head jerks up from the rush. mia imitating steppenwolf i said goddamn int. jackrabbit slims dining area  night vincent digs into his douglas sirk steak. as he chews, his eyes scan the hellsapopinish restaurant. mia comes back to the table. mia dont you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you vincent were lucky we got it at all. buddy holly doesnt seem to be much of a waiter. we shoulda sat in marilyn monroes section. mia which one, theres two marilyn monroes. vincent no theres not. pointing at marilyn in the white dress serving a table. vincent thats marilyn monroe... then, pointing at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of film geeks  vincent ... and thats mamie van doren. i dont see jayne mansfield, so it must be her night off. mia pretty smart. vincent i have moments. mia did ya think of something to say vincent actually, theres something ive wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and i didnt want to offend you. mia oooohhhh, this doesnt sound like mindless, boring, gettingtoknow you chitchat. this sounds like you actually have something to say. vincent only if you promise not to get offended. mia you cant promise something like that. i have no idea what youre gonna ask. you could ask me what youre gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. then, through no fault of my own, i woulda broken my promise. vincent then lets just forget it. mia that is an impossibility. trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility. vincent is that a fact mia nods her head yes. mia besides, its more exciting when you dont have permission. vincent what do you think about what happened to antwan mia whos antwan vincent tony rocky horror. mia he fell out of a window. vincent thats one way to say it. another way is, he was thrown out. another was is, he was thrown out by marsellus. and even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you. mia is that a fact vincent no its not, its just what i heard. mia who told you this vincent they. mia and vincent smile. mia they talk a lot, dont they vincent they certainly do. mia well dont by shy vincent, what exactly did they say vincent is slow to answer. mia let me help you bashful, did it involve the fword vincent no. they just said rocky horror gave you a foot massage. mia and... vincent no and, thats it. mia you heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a fourstory window because he massaged my feet vincent yeah. mia and you believed that vincent at the time i was told, it seemed reasonable. mia marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable vincent no, it seemed excessive. but that doesnt mean it didnt happen. i heard marsellus is very protective of you. mia a husband being protective of his wife is one thing. a husband almost killing another man for touching his wifes feet is something else. vincent but did it happen mia the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. i met anwan once  at my wedding  then never again.  the truth is, nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and tony rocky horror. but when you scamps get together, youre worse than a sewing circle. cut to ed sullivan and marilyn monroe stand on stage ed sullivan into microphone ladies and gentlemen, now the moment youve all been waiting for, the worldfamous jackrabbit slims twist

music and drinks mia moves away to attend to both. vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove. vincent im gonna take a piss. mia that was a little bit more information than i needed to know, but go right ahead. vincent shuffles off to the john. mia moves to her cd player, thumbs through a stack of cds and selects one k.d. lang. the speakers blast out a high energy country number, which mia plays airguitar to. she dances her way around the room and finds herself by vincents overcoat hanging on the rack. she touches its sleeve. it feels good. her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. mia thinks so anyway. her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his zippo lighter. she slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancystyle like vince did. what do you know, she did it mias one happy clam. she triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the zippo closed. the miamade cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. her hand slides the zippo back in the overcoat pocket. but wait, her fingers touch something else. those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that vincent bought earlier from lance. wearing a big smile, mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. mia like you would say bingo disco vince, you little cola nut, youve been holding out on me. cut to int. bathroom marsellus wallaces house  night vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror. vincent

lines on her glass top coffee table. taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human dustbuster, she quickly snorts the fat line. closeup  mia her head jerks back. her hands go to her nose which feels like its on fucking fire, something is terribly wrong. then... the rush hits... bathroom vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. vincent ...its a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. because when people are loyal to each other, thats very meaningful. living room mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but its like shes trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. blood begins to drip from mias nose. then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits. bathroom vince continues. vincent so youre gonna go out there, drink your drink, say goodnight, ive had a very lovely evening, go home, and jack off.  and thats all youre gonna do. now that hes given himself a little pep talk, vincents ready for whatevers waiting for him on the other side of that door. so he goes through it. living room we follow behind vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. shes twisted on her back. blood and puke are down her front. and her face is contorted. not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. slackjawed. vincent jesus christ vincent moves like greased lightning to mias fallen body. bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. she slightly stirs. mia is aware of vincent over her, speaking to her. vincent sounding weird mia mia what the hell happened but shes unable to communicate mia makes a few lost mumbles, but theyre not distinctive enough to be called words. vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story. vincent to himself ill be a sonofabitch. to mia mia mia what did you take answer me honey, what did you take mia is incapable of answering. he slaps her face hard. vincent springs up and runs to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. he goes through the pockets frantically. its gone. vincent makes a beeline to mia. we follow. vincent yelling to mia okay honey, were getting you on your feet. he reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms. vincent

cloth robe. in his hand is a bowl of capn crunch with crunch berries. in front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the capn crunch with crunch berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray. on the bigscreen tv in front of the table is the three stooges, and theyre getting married. preacher emil simkus on tv hold hands, you love birds. the phone rings. lance puts down his

look, just keep talkin to her, okay while shes gettin the shot, i gotta get a medical book. vincent what do you need a medical book for lance to tell me how to do it. ive never given an adrenaline

then get it. lance i am, if youll let me. vincent im not fuckin stoppin you. lance stop talkin to me, and start talkin to her. we follow lance as he runs out of the living room into a... int. spare

living room. living room vincent is bent over mia, talking softly to her, when lance reenters the room. vincent quit fuckin around man and give her the shot lance bends down by the black case brought in by jody. he opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection. lance while im doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart. vince rips her blouse open. jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action. vincent does it have to be exact lance yeah, it has to be exact im giving her an injection in the heart, so i gotta exactly hit her in the heart. vincent well, i dont know exactly where her heart is, i think its here. vince points to mias right breast.  lance glances over and nods. lance thats it. as lance readies the injection, vincent looks up at jody. vincent i need a big fat magic marker, got one jody what vincent i need a big fat magic marker, any felt penll do, but a magic marker would be great. jody hold on. jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which bills, papers, pens spill to the floor. the injection is ready. lance hands vincent the needle. lance its ready, ill tell you what to do. vincent youre gonna give her the shot. lance no, youre gonna give her the shot. vincent ive never does this before. lance ive never done this before either, and i aint starting

marker in her hand. jody got it. vincent grabs the magic marker out of jodys hand and makes a big red dot on mias body where her heart is. vincent okay, what do i do lance well, youre giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. but shes got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. so what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion. lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like the shape killing its victims in halloween. vincent i gotta stab her lance if you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. then once you do, push down on the plunger. vincent what happens after that lance im curious about that myself. vincent this aint a fuckin joke man lance shes supposed to come out of it like  snaps his fingers  that. vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. he looks down on mia. mia is fading fast. soon nothing will help her. vincents eyes narrow, ready to do this. vincent count to three. lance, on this knees right beside vincent, does not know what to expect. lance one... red dot on mias body. needle raised ready to strike. lance o.s. ...two... jodys face is alive with anticipation. needle in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. lance o.s. ...three the needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard. vincent brings the needle down hard, stabbing mia in the chest. mias head is jolted from the impact. the syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. mias eyes pop wide open and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. she bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest  screaming. vincent, lance and jody, who were in sitting positions in front of mia, jump back, scared to death. mias scream runs out. she slowly starts taking breaths of air. the other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if shes alright. lance if youre okay, say something. mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. mia something. vincent and lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death mia came. jody anybody

never ever hear of this incident. mia smiles. mia dont worry about it. if marsellus ever heard of this, id be in as much trouble as you. vincent i seriously doubt that. mia if you can keep a secret, so can i. vincent lets shake on it. the two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do. vincent mums the word. mia lets go of vincents hand and silently makes the seeno evil, hearnoevil, and speaknoevil sign with her hands. vincent smiles. vincent if youll excuse me, i gotta go home and have a heart attack. mia giggles. vincent turns to leave. mia you still wanna

ill tell it. vincent i cant wait. mia three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. the baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. the poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him  stamps on the ground  and says catch up. they both smile, but neither laugh. mia see ya round, vince. mia turns and

year 1972. butchs mother, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room. next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an american air force officer. the camera is the perspective of a fiveyear old boy. mother butch, stop watching tv a second. we got a special visitor. now do you remember when i told you your daddy dies in a p.o.w. camp butch o.s. uhhuh. mother well this here is capt. koons. he was in the p.o.w. camp with daddy. capt. koons steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boys eyeline. when koons speaks, he speaks with a slight texas accent. capt. koons hello, little man. boy i sure heard a bunch about you. see, i was a good friend of your daddys. we were in that hanoi pit of hell over five years together.  hopefully, youll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. if it had been me who had not made it, major coolidge would be talkin right now to my son jim. but the way it worked out is im talkin to you, butch. i got somethin for ya. the captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket. capt. koons this watch i got here was first purchased by your greatgranddaddy. it was bought during the first world war in a little general store in knoxville, tennessee. it was bought by private doughboy ernie coolidge the day he set sail for paris. it was your greatgranddaddys war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. you see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. your greatgranddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol coffee can. and in that can it stayed til your grandfather dane coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the germans once again. this time they called it world war two. your greatgranddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. unfortunately, danes luck wasnt as good as his old mans. your granddad was a marine and he was killed with all the other marines at the battle of wake island. your granddad was facing death and he knew it. none of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin that island alive. so three days before the japanese took the island, your 22year old grandfather asked a gunner on an air force transport named winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. three days later, your grandfather was dead. but winocki kept his word. after the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his dads gold watch. this watch. this watch was on your daddys wrist when he was shot down over hanoi. he was captured and put in a vietnamese prison camp. now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch itd be confiscated. the way your daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. and hed be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boys birthright. so he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin. his ass. five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. i hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. then, after seven years, i was sent home to my family. and now, little man, i give the watch to you. capt. koons hands the watch to butch. a little hand comes into frame to accept it. cut to int. locker room  night the 27year old butch coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia trunks, shoes and gloves. he lies on a table catching a few zzzzzzs before his big fight. almost as soon as we cut to him, he wakes up with a start. shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove. his trainer klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind klondike in the hallway. klondike its time, butch. butch im ready. klondike steps inside, closing the door on the wild mob outside. he goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. butch hops off the table and, without a word, klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back battling butch coolidge. the two men head for the door. klondike opens the door for butch. as butch steps into the hallway, the crowd goes apeshit. klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room. fade

going back in the bathroom. we stay on the wide shot of the unconscious butch in bed. fade to black fade up motel room  morning same shot as before, the next morning. we find butch still asleep in

screams in horror. butch looks toward her, suddenly calm. butch to fabienne no its not your fault. he approached her you left it at the apartment. he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. he touches her hand, she flinches. butch if you did leave it at the apartment, its not your fault. i had you bring a bunch of stuff. i reminded you about it, but i didnt illustrate how personal the watch was to me. if all i gave a fuck about was my watch, i shouldve told you. you aint a mind reader. he kisses her hand. then rises. fabienne is still sniffling. butch goes to the closet. fabienne im sorry. butch puts on his high school jacket. butch dont be. it just means i wont be able to eat breakfast with you. fabienne why does it mean that butch because im going back to my

fabienne i was so dreadful. i saw your watch, i thought i brought it. im so sorry. butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face. butch dont feel bad, sugar pop. nothing you could ever do

sugar pop. fabienne bye. butch im gonna take your honda. fabienne okay. and with that, hes out the door. fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her. int. honda moving  day butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street. butch of all the fuckin things she coulda forgot, she forgets my fathers watch. i specifically reminded her not to forget it. bedside table  on the kangaroo. i said the words dont forget my fathers watch. ext. city street  day the little honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. cut to a parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour. ext. residential street corner  day butch isnt completely reckless. he has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin through the front door. ext. alley  day butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. ext. street  butchs apartment  day everything seems normal. more or less the right number of cars in the street. none of the parked cars appear out of place. none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of butchs home. butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. across the street from butchs building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant. a big sign sticks up in the air, with the name teriyaki donut and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice. ext. butchs apartment courtyard  day butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building. once again, everything appears normal  the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears disturbed. butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. he steps outside the door and listens inside. nothing. butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. int. butchs apartment  day his apartment hasnt been touched. he cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. obviously, no one is there. butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. with carton in hard, butch surveys the apartment. then he goes to the bedroom. his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean and anonymous. the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an olympic silver medal, a framed issue of ring magazine with butch on the cover, and a poster of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo. sure enough, theres the watch just like he said it was on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts. putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster. butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. what he sees is a small compact czech m61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. butch softly holy shit. he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. then... a toilet flushes. butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. there is someone behind it. like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, butch freezes, not knowing what to do. the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. in his hand is the book modesty blaise by peter odonnell. vincent and butch lock eyes. vincent freezes. butch doesnt move, except to point the m61 in vincents direction. neither man opens his mouth. then... the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts. thats all the situation needed. butchs finger hits the trigger. muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun. vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously  lifting him off his feet, propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger, vincent is annihilated. butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. with the respect it deserves, butch carefully places the m61 back on the kitchen counter. then he exits the apartment, quickly. ext. apartment courtyard  day butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... ...goes through the alley... ...and into his car in one steadicam shot. ext. honda  day butch cranks the car into gear and drives away. the big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face. ext. apartment building street  day the honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building. int. honda  day butch looks out the window at his former home. butch thats how youre gonna beat em, butch.  they keep underestimatin ya. this makes the boxer laugh out loud. as he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. when the music starts, he sings along with it. he drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from teriyaki donut. butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see through the windshield the big man himself, marsellus wallace, exit teriyaki donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. he steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of butchs car. this is the first time we see marsellus clearly. laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. when marsellus is in front of butchs car, he casually glances to his left, sees butch, continues walking... then stops doubletake am i really seeing what im seeing butch doesnt wait for the big man to answer his own question. he stomps on the gas pedal. the little honda slams into marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. butch cuts into cross traffic and is broadsided by a gold camaro z28, breaking all the windows in the honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was fabiennes honda. blood flows from his nostrils. the stillfunctional tape player continues to play. a pedestrian pokes his head inside. pedestrian jesus, are you okay butch look at him, spacedout. butch i guess. marsellus wallace lies sprawled out in the street. gawkers gather around the body. gawker 1 to the others hes dead hes dead this jerks yelling makes marsellus come to. two pedestrians help the shaken butch out of the wreckage. the woozy marsellus gets to his feet. gawker 2 if you need a witness in court, ill be glad to help. he was a drunken maniac. he hit you and crashed into that car. marsellus still incoherent who gawker 2 pointing at butch him. marsellus follows the gawkers finger and sees butch coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. marsellus well, ill be damned. the big man takes out a .45 automatic and the gawkers back away. marsellus starts moving toward butch. butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly beeline toward him. butch sacre bleu. marsellus brings up his weapon and fires, but hes so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild. he hits a lookyloo woman in the hip. she falls to the ground, screaming. lookyloo woman oh my god, ive been shot thats all butch needs to see. hes outta here. marsellus runs after him. the crowd looks agape. butch is in a mad, limping run. the big mans hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run. butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads masondixie pawnshop. int. masondixie pawnshop  day maynard, a hillbillylookin boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of butch races into his world. maynard can i help you wit somethin butch shut up butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door. maynard now you just wait one goddamn minute  before maynard can finish his threat, marsellus charges in. he doesnt get past the doorway because butch lands his fist in marsellus face. the gangsters feet go out from under him and the big man falls flat on his back. outside, two police cars with their sirens blaring race by. butch pounces on the fallen body, punching him twice more in the face. butch takes the gun out of marsellus hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger. butch so you like chasing people, huh he breaks the finger. marsellus lets out a pain sound.  butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, pulls back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter. butch well guess what, big man, you caught me  maynard o.s.  hold it right there, godammit butch and marsellus look up at maynard, whos brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men. butch look mister, this aint any of your business  maynard  im makin it my business now toss that gun butch does. maynard now you on top, stand up and come to the counter. butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. as soon as he gets there, maynard hauls off, hitting him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking butch down and out. after butch goes down, maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone. marsellus wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. then it picks up. maynard zed its maynard. the spider just caught a coupla flies. marsellus passes out. fade to black fade up int. pawnshop back room  day two shot  butch and marsellus they are tied up in two separate chairs. in their mouths are two smstyle ball gags a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths. both men are unconscious. maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until theyre wide awake and wet as otters. the two prisoners look up at their captors. maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and marsellus .45 sticking in his belt. maynard nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or zed. a buzzer buzzes. maynard thats zed. without saying another word, maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them. we hear, on the other side of the curtains, maynard let zed inside the store. butch and marsellus look around the room. the basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. after taking in their predicament, butch and marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what theyve gotten themselves into. maynard and zed come through the curtains. zed is an even more intense version of maynard, if such a thing is possible. the two hillbillys are obviously brothers. where maynard is a vicious pitbull, zed is a deadly cobra. zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. he inspects them for a long time, then says zed to maynard you said you waited for me maynard i did. zed then how come theyre all beat up maynard they did that to each other. they was fightin when they came in. this one was gonna shoot that one. zed to butch you were gonna shoot him butch makes no reply. zed hey, is grace gonna be okay in front of this place maynard yeah, it aint tuesday is it zed no, its thursday. maynard then shell be fine. zed bring out the gimp. maynard i think the gimps sleepin. zed well, i guess youll just wake em up then, wont you maynard opens a trap door in the floor. maynard yelling in the hole wake up maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash. he gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises the gimp. the gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. there are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. on his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper closed for a mouth. they keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog. zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. maynard hands the gimps leash to zed, then backs away. maynard to the gimp down the gimp gets on its knees. maynard hangs back while zed appraises the two men. maynard whos first zed i aint fer sure yet. then with his little finger, zed does a silent eenie, meany, miney, moe...  just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two. butch are marsellus are terrified. maynard looks back and forth at the victims. the gimpss eyes go from one to the other inside the mask. zed continues his silent singsong with his finger moving left to right, then it stops. two shot  butch and marsellus after a beat, the camera moves to the right, zeroing in on marsellus. zed stands up. zed wanna do it here maynard naw, drag big boy to russells old room. zed grabs marsellus chair and drags him into russells old room. russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the masondixie pawnshop. whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. as marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russells old room. maynard to the gimp up the gimp rises. maynard ties the gimps leash to a hook on the ceiling. maynard keep an eye on this one. the gimp bows its head yes. maynard disappears into russells old room. there must be a stereo in there because suddenly the judds, singing in harmony, fills the air. butch looks at the gimp. the gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. from behind the door we hear country music, struggling, and maynard o.s. whoa, this boys got a bit of fight in em we the hear maynard and zed beat on marsellus. zed o.s. you wanna fight you wanna fight good, i like to fight butch pauses, listens to the voices. then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free. the gimp is laughing wildly. the ropes are on too tight and butch cant break free. the gimp slaps his knee laughing in the back room, we hear maynard o.s. thats it... thats it boy, youre goin fine. oooooooh, just like that... thats good. grunting faster stay still... stay still goddamn ya zed goddammit, git over here and hold em butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt. the gimp sees this and its eyes widen. the gimp huhng the gimp flails wildly, trying to get the leash off the hook. he tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three boxers punches to its face. the punches knock the gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook, butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains. int. pawnshop  day butch sneaks to the door. on the counter is a big set of keys with a large z connected to the ring. grabbing them, hes about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with marsellus. butch decides for the life of him, he cant leave anybody in a situation like that. se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies heads in with. he picks up a big destructivelooking hammer, then discards it not destructive enough. he picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. next, a large louisville slugger he tries on for size. but then he spots what hes been looking for a samurai sword. it hands in its handcarved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon dads oldfashioned root beer sign. butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. its a magnificent piece of steel. it seems to glisten in the lowwattage light of the pawnshop. butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. not on your life. its as sharp as it gets. this weapon seems made to order for the brothers grimm downstairs. holding the sword pointed downward, takakura kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business. int. pawnshop back room  day butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. sodomy and the judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to russells old room. int. russells old room  day butchs hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. it swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. zed is now bent over marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. maynard watches. both have their backs to butch. maynard faces the camera, grinning, while butch comes up behind him with the sword. miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see butch coming up behind maynard. his eyes widen. butch hey hillbilly. maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword. butch screams... with one mighty swing, slashes maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on zed. maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. butch, while never taking his eyes off zed, thrusts the sword behind him, skewering maynard, then extracts it, pointing the blade toward zed. maynard collapses. zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butchs sword to marsellus .45 automatic, which lies within reach. butchs eyes follow zeds. butch you want that gun, zed pick it up. zeds hand inches toward the weapon. butch grips the sword tighter. zed studies butch. butch looks hard at zed. then a voice says marsellus o.s. step aside, butch. butch steps aside, revealing marsellus standing behind him, holding maynards pumpaction shotgun. kaboom zed is blasted in the groin. down he goes, screaming in agony. marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, ejects the used shotgun shell. butch lowers the sword and hangs back. not a word, until butch you okay marsellus naw man. im pretty fuckin far from okay long pause. butch what now marsellus what now well let me tell you what now.  im gonna call a couple pipe hittin niggers, wholl go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. to zed hear me talkin hillbilly boy i aint through with you by a damn sight. im gonna git medieval on your ass. butch i meant what now, between me and you marsellus oh, that what now well, let me tell ya what now between me an you. there is no me an you. not no more. butch so were cool marsellus yeah man, were cool. one thing i ask  two things i ask dont tell nobody about this. this shits between me and you and the soontobelivin therestofhisshortasslifein agonizingpain, mr. rapist here. it aint nobody elses business. two leave town. tonight. right now. and when youre gone, stay gone.  youve lost your los angeles privileges. deal butch deal. the two men shake hands, then hug one another. marsellus go on now, get your ass outta here. butch leaves russells old room through the red curtains. marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number. marsellus into the phone hello mr. wolf, its marsellus. gotta bit of a situation. ext. masondixie pawnshop  day butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. he looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, zeds big chrome chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name grace on it. he climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big z on them and starts up the huge hog. it rumbles to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. butch twists the accelerator handle and speeds off. we cut back and forth between... int. butch and fabiennes hotel room  day fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a frankie says, relax teeshirt, singing along with music coming from a boom box. ext. city street  chopper moving  day butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named grace. he checks his fathers watch. it says 1030. the song in the motel room plays over this. ext. motel room  day butch rides up on grace. he hops off and runs inside the motel room, while we stay outside with the bike. fabienne o.s. butch, i was so worried butch honey, grab your radio and your purse and lets go fabienne o.s. but what about all our bags butch fuck the bags. well miss our train if we dont split now. fabienne o.s. is everything well are we in danger butch were cool. in fact, were super cool. but we gots to go. ill wait for you outside. butch runs out and hops back on the bike. fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse. when she sees butch on the chopper, she stops dead. fabienne where did you get this motorcycle butch he kickstarts it its a chopper, baby, hop on. fabienne slowly approaches the twowheel demon. fabienne what happened to my honda butch sorry baby, i crashed the honda. fabienne youre hurt butch i mightve broke my nose, no biggie. hop on. she doesnt move. butch looks at her. butch honey, we gotta hit the fuckin road fabienne starts to cry. butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. he turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. butch im sorry, babylove. fabienne crying you were gone so long, i started to think dreadful thoughts. butch im sorry i worried you, sweetie. everythings fine. hey, how was breakfast fabienne waterworks drying

butch its a chopper. fabienne whose chopper is this butch zeds. fabienne whos zed butch zeds dead, baby, zeds dead. and with that, the two lovebirds peel away on grace, as the song on the boom box rises. fade to black title card jules vincent jimmie  the wolf title disappears. over black, we can hear in the distance, men talking. jules o.s. you ever read the bible, brett brett o.s. yes jules o.s. theres a passage i got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation ezekiel 2517. the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men... fade up int. bathroom  day were in the bathroom of the hollywood apartment we were in earlier. in fact, were there at exactly the same time. except this time, were in the bathroom with the fourth man. the fourth man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to whats being said on the other side of the door, tightly clutching his huge silver .357 magnum. jules o.s. ...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. bang bang boom pow bam bam bam bam bam the fourth man freaks out. he throws himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door. then he listens to them talk. vincent o.s. friend of yours jules o.s. yeah, marvinvincentvincentmarvin. waiting for them isnt the smartest move. bursting out the door and blowing them all away while theyre fuckin around is the way to go. int. apartment  day the bathroom door bursts open and the fourth man charges out, silver magnum raised, firing six booming shots from his hand cannon. fourth man die... die... die... die... dolly into fourth man, same as before. he scream until hes dry firing. then a look of confusion crosses his face. two shot  jules and vincent standing next to each other, unharmed. amazing as it seems, none of the fourth mans shots appear to have hit anybody. jules and vincent exchange looks like, are we hit theyre as confused at the shooter. after looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the fourth man. fourth man i dont understand  the fourth man is taken out of the scenario by the two mens bullets who, unlike his, hit their marks. he drops dead. the two men lower their guns. jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off. then heads toward marvin in the corner. vincent why the fuck didnt you tell us about that guy in the bathroom slip your

possible. and im sorry jules, but i dont think what happened this morning qualifies. jules dont you see, vince, that shit dont matter. youre judging this thing the wrong way. its not about what. it could be god stopped the bullets, he changed coke into pepsi, he found my fuckin car keys. you dont judge shit like this based on merit. whether or not what we experienced was an accordingtohoyle miracle is insignificant. what is significant is i felt gods touch, god got involved. vincent but why jules thats whats fuckin wit me i dont know why. but i cant go back to sleep. vincent so youre serious, youre really gonna quit jules the life, most definitely. vincent takes a bite of food. jules takes a sip of coffee in the b.g., we see a patron call the waitress. patron garcon coffee we

quiet, not everybody heard it, but honey bunny senses somethings wrong. honey bunny whats goin on pumpkin looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. honey bunny shoot em in the face jules i dont mean

closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to pumpkin. pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. like a rattlesnake, jules free hand grabs the wrist of pumpkins gun hand, slamming it on the table. his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his .45 hand under pumpkins chin. honey bunny freaks out, waving her gun in jules direction. honey bunny let him go

ass. vincent o.s. what the fucks goin on here yolanda whips her gun toward the stranger. vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, deadaimed at yolanda. jules its cool, vincent its cool dont do a goddamn thing. yolanda, its cool baby, nothins changed. were still just talkin. to pumpkin tell her were still cool. pumpkin its cool, honey bunny, were still cool. vincent gun raised what the hells goin on, jules jules nothin i cant handle. i want you to just hang back and dont do shit unless its absolutely necessary. vincent check. jules yolanda, how we doin, baby yolanda i gotta go pee i want to go home. jules just hang in there, baby, youre doing great, ringos proud of you and so am i.  its almost over. to pumpkin now i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet. pumpkin which one is it jules its the one that says bad motherfucker on it. pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  theres a wallet with bad motherfucker embroidered on it. jules thats my bad motherfucker. now open it up and take out the cash. how much is there pumpkin about fifteen hundred dollars. jules put it in your pocket, its yours. now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score. vincent jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, im gonna shoot em on general principle. jules you aint gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. besides, i aint givin it to him. im buyin somethin for my money. wanna know what im buyin ringo pumpkin what jules your life. im givin you that money so i dont hafta kill your ass. you read the bible pumpkin not regularly. jules theres a passage i got memorized. ezekiel 2517. the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you. i been sayin that shit for years.  and if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. i never really questioned what it meant. i thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker fore you popped a cap in his ass. but i saw some shit this mornin made me think twice. now im thinkin, it could mean youre the evil man. and im the righteous man.  and mr. .45 here, hes the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. or is could by youre the righteous man and im the shepherd and its the world thats evil and selfish.  id like that. but that shit aint the truth. the truth is youre the weak. and im the tyranny of evil men. but im tryin. im tryin real hard to be a shepherd. jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to yolanda. she looks back. grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two run out the door. jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee. jules to himself its cold. he pushes it aside. vincent appears next to jules. vincent i think we oughta leave now. jules thats probably a good idea. vincent throws some money on the table and jules grabs the briefcase. then, to the amazement of the patrons, the waitresses, the cooks, the bus boys, and the manager, these two badass dudes  wearing uc santa cruz and im with stupid teeshirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 automatics  walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word. fade out the end'"
